    preserving the old fortifications on Butt’s Hill, Portsmouth, R. I., near Newport. These
    fortifications were constructed by Gen. John Sullivan in 1778. The matter was submitted
    to the Society at the gathering in Newport on the 29th inst., and the project heartily
    commended.

<p class='c010'>The business session was well attended, several states being
represented.</p>

<p class='c006'>Thomas Hamilton Murray, secretary-general of the Society,
presented the following annual report:</p>

<div class="section"></div>
<h3 class='c007'>REPORT OF THE SECRETARY-GENERAL.</h3>

<p class='c011'>The American-Irish Historical Society is on the threshold of its
fourth year of existence. We are strong in numbers, representative
in character and devoted to a patriotic work.</p>

<p class='c012'>Our growth as an organization has been rapid, but not unstable;
widespread, but healthy; vigorous, and of permanent value.</p>

<p class='c012'>We have solid reason to be proud of what the Society has accomplished
during the three years it has been in the field. We have
been accorded a generous welcome from historical societies long
in existence; our advent has been hailed with satisfaction; our
motives praised; our publications eagerly sought.</p>

<p class='c012'>To-night we meet in New York city for the third time, and for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>the third time we are indebted to our New York members for unbounded
hospitality, kindliest service and tireless efforts to make
our annual gathering a success.</p>

<p class='c012'>During the year just closed, ninety-two new members have been
admitted to the Society, and ten of our brothers have died. These
deaths of the year removed from our ranks the following: Hon.
Patrick Walsh, Augusta, Ga.; Col. Patrick T. Hanley, Boston,
Mass.; Hon. John H. Sullivan, Boston, Mass.; Hon. Eli Thayer,
Worcester, Mass.; Dr. William F. Cummings, Rutland, Vt.; Mr.
Joseph J. Kelley, Cambridge, Mass.; Mr. William Slattery, Holyoke,
Mass.; Rev. George W. Pepper, Cleveland, O.; Rev. Denis Scannell,
Worcester, Mass.; and Mr. Edmund Phelan, Boston, Mass.</p>

<p class='c012'>Since our last annual gathering in this city, meetings under the
auspices of the Society have been held in Providence, R. I., Newport,
R. I., and Boston, Mass. In each instance great interest was
manifested in the mission of the organization, and new members
were secured.</p>

<p class='c012'>Among those in attendance at the Providence meeting was Hon.
John D. Crimmins, our esteemed general vice-president. On that
occasion he subscribed $500 to forward the interests of the Society,
this being the largest individual gift the organization has thus far
received. Among the speakers at this meeting were the Rev.
S. B. Nelson, an Irish Presbyterian clergyman, and Rev. Frank L.
Phalen, a Unitarian.</p>

<p class='c012'>At the Newport meeting, the mayor of the city, Hon. Patrick J.
Boyle, a member of our Society, presided and delivered an address
of welcome. Addresses were also made by Hon. Charles E. Gorman
of Providence; by Rev. Louis J. Deady, a Catholic rector of
Newport; by City Solicitor Brown of Newport; by Dennis H. Tierney
of Waterbury, Conn.; by Hon. John C. Linehan of Concord,
N. H., and other gentlemen.</p>

<p class='c012'>At the Boston meeting, President-General Gargan presided, and
there were addresses by Hon. Patrick A. Collins of Boston and a
number of others.</p>

<p class='c012'>Nor, during the year, has the Society been idle in the field of
research. Of our members: Mr. Edward Fitzpatrick, Louisville,
Ky., has contributed a paper on “The Irish Settlers of Kentucky”;
Mr. Daniel M. O’Driscoll, Charleston, S. C., has written on “David
Hamilton, an Irish Soldier of the American Revolution”; Mr.
Thomas F. O’Malley, Somerville, Mass., has devoted much investigation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>relative to “The Early Transportation of Irish Men, Women
and Children to the West Indies, to Virginia, and to New England”;
Hon. John C. Linehan, Concord, N. H., has prepared a paper “On
the Irish Pioneers of Texas”; Mr. M. E. Hennessy, Boston, Mass.,
on “Men of Irish Birth or Extraction Who Have Attained Distinction
in American Journalism”; and Mr. Joseph Smith, Lowell, Mass.,
on “The Irish Brigade of Rochambeau’s Army in the American
Revolutionary War.” Mr. Thomas Carroll, Peabody, Mass., a
member of our Society, recently delivered an historical address at
a church anniversary in that place.</p>

<p class='c012'>Two of the leading works by our members during the year are
those of Rev. John J. McCoy of Chicopee, Mass., and Rev. James H.
O’Donnell of Watertown, Conn. The former has written a history
of the Catholic diocese of Springfield, Mass., and the latter of the
Catholic diocese of Hartford, Conn. Both these productions are
rich in reference to early Irish settlers, that of Rev. Father O’Donnell
being practically a history of the Irish in Connecticut.</p>

<p class='c012'>The annual bound volume of our Society is now in press. It will
be larger than the book we issued last year, will be illustrated and
will contain many papers, addresses and other matter of historical
and literary value.</p>

<p class='c012'>At our last annual meeting, the matter of a publication fund was
discussed and referred to the council of the Society for action.
The council subsequently decided to issue a circular letter inviting
contributions to said fund.</p>

<p class='c012'>It was decided to send out these circulars immediately after some
important gathering under the auspices of the Society, when they
would be likely to attract special interest. The launching of the
United States torpedo-boat <i>O’Brien</i>, at Elizabeth, N. J., was finally
decided upon as such event.</p>

<p class='c012'>Owing to unavoidable delay, however, this launching has not yet
taken place, and thus a desirable opportunity has not, up to this
time, presented itself to formulate the circular. I would suggest,
however, that this meeting possesses the desired prominence as a
Society event, and that the circular can now be sent out within the
next week or two.</p>

<p class='c012'>During the year, Dr. Thomas Addis Emmet of this city has voluntarily
subscribed $100 toward the publication fund, and four New
York gentlemen—Mr. Myles Tierney, Mr. Stephen J. Geoghegan,
Mr. James McGovern and Mr. John J. Lenehan—have each forwarded
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>a check for $50 in payment of life membership fee. Mr.
William Gorman of Philadelphia, Pa., has also become a life member.</p>

<p class='c012'>In April next, the historic town of Lexington, Mass., is to have a
great celebration of the anniversary of the battle of April 19, 1775,
and our Society has been invited to be represented on that occasion.</p>

<p class='c012'>Some months ago, a Franco-American Historical Society was
organized at Boston, at which an official of our Society was present
and made an address of congratulation. The new organization
will devote itself to the French chapter in American history.</p>

<p class='c012'>In conclusion, I desire to say that the correspondence of the
Society has already become of considerable volume. Inquiries from
all sections of the country are being constantly received. The
writers seek information or data of an historical nature relative to
the Irish and their descendants in the United States. These inquiries
are promptly answered, and, in return, we receive much
valuable material.</p>

<p class='c010'>The foregoing report was accepted and adopted.</p>

<div class="section"></div>
<h3 class='c007'>REPORT OF THE TREASURER-GENERAL.</h3>

<p class='c010'>The treasurer-general of the Society, Hon. John C. Linehan
of Concord, N. H., then presented his annual report. It showed
the total income for the year 1899 to have been $2,228.50.
Cash balance on hand Jan. 1, 1899, $518.60, thus making the
total financial resources of the Society for the year $2,747.10.</p>

<p class='c006'>The expenditures for 1899, as set forth in detail in the
report, were $2,008.86, leaving a balance on hand of $738.24.</p>

<p class='c006'>Joseph Smith of Lowell, Mass., for the auditing committee,
reported having examined the books and vouchers of the
treasurer-general and found the same correct.</p>

<p class='c006'>The treasurer-general’s report was thereupon accepted and
adopted.</p>

<p class='c006'>A communication to the society was announced from Hon.
Theodore Roosevelt, governor of New York, in which he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>invited the members to be his guests at the executive mansion
in Albany.</p>

<p class='c006'>The invitation was appreciatively received and acknowledged,
and the president-general was authorized to appoint a delegation
to represent the society by a visit to the governor.</p>

<p class='c006'>The president-general announced that he would do so, and
state the make-up of the delegation later.</p>

<p class='c006'>Hon. T. A. E. Weadock of Detroit, Mich., an ex-member
of Congress, presented the names of several applicants for
membership in the Society, and the said applicants were unanimously
admitted.</p>

<p class='c006'>Various other gentlemen also presented many applications
for membership, and the same were all favorably acted upon.</p>

<p class='c006'>The annual election of officers of the Society then took
place, the result being the same as given on pages <a href='#Page_5'>5</a>, <a href='#Page_6'>6</a> and <a href='#Page_7'>7</a>
of this volume.</p>

<p class='c006'>Upon the conclusion of the business meeting, the members
and guests formed in line and proceeded to the banquet hall.</p>

<div class="section"></div>
<h3 class='c007'>ANNUAL BANQUET OF THE SOCIETY.</h3>

<p class='c010'>The company around the tables numbered about one hundred
and thirty gentlemen. President-General Gargan presided.
An orchestra was stationed in the balcony. The decorations
were profuse, and were artistically placed.</p>

<p class='c006'>Grace was said by Rev. John J. McCoy of Chicopee, Mass.</p>

<div class="section"></div>
<h3 class='c007'>THE PRESIDENT-GENERAL’S ADDRESS.</h3>

<p class='c010'>President-General Gargan, in rising to open the exercises,
spoke substantially as follows:</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Gentlemen of the American-Irish Historical Society</span>: In
January, 1897, the first meeting to organize this Society was called
at Boston. As the reports show, we have now nearly 1,000 members
residing in almost every state and territory in the United
States, and representing the best elements in the several walks of
life.</p>

<p class='c012'>Our object is to see that history is written fairly and impartially.
During the last twenty-five years we have adopted new methods in
writing history. The historian who is to write on any epoch no
longer accepts as truth the recorded facts of another historian who
has written of a former epoch. He challenges every statement
made unless corroborated or verified by documentary proof.</p>

<p class='c012'>We now have access to many valuable papers and letters that
throw a new light upon men, their motives and action.</p>

<p class='c012'>The history of the United States has been largely written by men
of English blood, who have unduly glorified the actions of their
ancestors. More critical and scientific examinations have shown us
that the Irish element contributed very largely to the settlement of
the colonies from New England to Georgia, and were an important
factor in bringing about the Revolution and establishing the
government of the United States.</p>

<p class='c012'>Our Society is now engaged in searching many of the colonial
records, and I suggest that the members in the different states of
the Union examine into the origin and ancestry of the prominent
men in their states, prepare information and write papers that may
be placed in the archives of this Society.</p>

<p class='c012'>I congratulate the members on the increase in numbers, the continued
prosperity of the Society, and urge all who can to contribute
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>liberally to the publication fund, for spoken words are often but
perishable things, and if the history of the part which our race and
blood have borne in upbuilding the Republic is to be preserved,
we can only keep alive the record of their sacrifices, their heroism
and their patriotism by preserving them in the form of permanent
memorials, books and publications of the Society.</p>

<div class="section"></div>
<h3 class='c007'>THE ADDRESS OF SENATOR CARTER.</h3>

<p class='c010'>Hon. Thomas H. Carter, U. S. senator from Montana, made
an eloquent address. In the course of his speech he paid
deserved compliments to Hon. P. A. Collins of Boston, Hon.
John D. Crimmins and General O’Beirne of New York, and
to other members of the society.</p>

<p class='c006'>Senator Carter showed the absurdity of calling the United
States an Anglo-Saxon country, and traced the expansion of the
original thirteen states, and the wonderful resources of America.
He said in substance:</p>

<p class='c011'>A new race has sprung up in this country better than Saxon or
Celt. The success of the Republic is due to the fact that it
unbridles manhood. The special purpose of this association is to
ascertain what part dear old Ireland has played in this drama.</p>

<p class='c012'>I am gratified beyond expression that this Society insists on seeing
justice done to the race from which we have sprung. The work
must be logical and correct. One of the most remarkable things
is the intellectuality of the Irish race.</p>

<p class='c012'>Wherever freedom’s flag is hoisted you will find an Irishman at
or near that emblem. O’Higgins in South America is synonymous
with liberty. On every battlefield in North America the Irishman
is found, as he also is in poetry, history, arts and sciences. I
would not adulate the race. The Irishman forms only a part of
the American citizenship. But whether it is in storming Manila or
the capital of Great Britain the Irishman will be found doing
his work enthusiastically.</p>

<p class='c012'>I would be delighted to see the Society extended to every state
of the Union. There are many, very many, incidents in connection
with the Irish race in America I would like to see set down. As a
rule the Irish hold the offices, not because they are Irish, but as a
recognition of ability and the eternal fitness of things.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>Senator Carter spoke eloquently in praise of Gen. Thomas
Francis Meagher, one of the original white settlers of Montana,
who died while holding the office of governor of that territory.</p>

<p class='c006'>Spirited addresses were also made by Hon. Thomas M.
Waller, ex-governor of Connecticut; Judge Wauhope Lynn of
New York city; Ex-Congressman Weadock of Michigan;
Hon. William McAdoo of New York; George E. Van Siclen,
who spoke eloquently in behalf of the Boers of South Africa,
and Gen. James R. O’Beirne of New York.</p>

<p class='c006'>Vocal selections were rendered during the evening, and Miss
Sullivan of New York gave selections on the harp.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Brothers</span>: You are hereby notified that the 125th anniversary of
the battle of Lexington and “the Concord Fight” will be observed
by our Society on Thursday, April 19, 1900.</p>

<p class='c012'>Our programme for this patriotic occasion will comprise two leading
features, namely: (1) A visit to Lexington, Mass., in the forenoon,
and (2) a banquet in the evening at the Hotel Bellevue, Boston,
Mass. Lady friends of the members will be welcome at both
events.</p>

<p class='c012'>The exercises prepared by the town of Lexington for the day
include a national salute of 45 guns, morning and evening, a drum
corps parade at dawn over the historic route of march, and a trades
procession about midday. Headquarters for the society will be
established in Lexington at the Russell House, where a reception
committee will be in attendance.</p>

<p class='c012'>The Society will pay its respects to the town officials of Lexington,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>will visit the several points of historic interest and will then
place a laurel wreath to the memory of the heroes of 1775. Members
and guests from Boston may take trains from the North Union
station, that city, at such hour in the morning as may suit their convenience,
all meeting at the Russell House, Lexington, about 11:30
a. m. Those desiring, may later take conveyances for Concord.</p>

<p class='c012'>The banquet in the evening at the Hotel Bellevue, Boston, promises
to be a brilliant event and should be attended by every member
who can possibly be present. Preceding the banquet, from 6:30 to
8, there will be a reception and concert, and at 8 p. m. the company
will proceed to the dining hall.</p>

<p class='c012'>Tickets for the banquet will be three dollars each, and are now
ready. Please notify the secretary as soon as possible if you intend

<div class="section"></div>
<h3 class='c007'><span class='sc'>Remarks of President-General Gargan.</span></h3>

<p class='c011'><i>Members and guests of the American-Irish Historical Society</i>:</p>

<p class='c012'>To-day we commemorate the deeds of those heroic men who on
April 19, 1775, on the green at Lexington, won a fame as imperishable
as the men who fought at Marathon or Thermopylæ. Well
might Sam Adams exclaim, “What a glorious morning for America
is this.” As a distinguished foreigner has well said, “It is their
sacrificed blood in which is written the preface of the nation’s history.”</p>

<p class='c012'>At Lexington was the opening scene of a revolution destined to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>change the character of human governments and the condition of
the human race. Yet I sometimes incline to the opinion, as I read
the utterances of men who in our day are called statesmen, and some
of the newspapers, that the age of patriotism has gone; that an age
of selfish materialists, economists, and calculators has succeeded.
Let us hope there is still a saving remnant in this republic which will
rekindle the love and patriotism which actuated the men who established
our government.</p>

<p class='c012'>Do some of the people really understand the meaning of patriotism?
Many seem to imagine it means blind obedience to any
administration which may be insidiously laboring to destroy our
institutions. But I have an abiding faith in the people of this country
when they fully appreciate a threatened danger. I believe with
Burke “that the people never give up their liberties but under some
delusion.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Are some of us laboring under the delusion that we are called
upon to govern the world, that we are to set forth with a few small
Bibles and a large supply of arms to force what we call our civilization
on an unwilling people in another hemisphere, while thoughtful
men are staggered at the problems of government confronting us on
the North American continent?</p>

<p class='c012'>Shall we not profit by the lessons of history and recall what this
day means? It was the beginning of a movement against an empire
which aspired to govern the world. Yet those men on Lexington
common initiated a revolution which wrested from the diadem of
Great Britain the fairest jewel in her crown. May we not indulge
to-day somewhat in retrospection and examine the causes which led
to our revolt?</p>

<p class='c012'>The British parliament had passed the stamp act, the tea tax and
the Boston port bill, yet those did not cause war; the real cause of
the battle of Lexington was the reconstruction act of 1774. Prior
to this act the councilors had been chosen by the people through
their representatives. By the new law the king was to appoint them,
to hold office during his pleasure. The superior judges were to hold
at the will of the king and to be dependent on his will for the
amount and payment of their salaries; the inferior judges were to be
removable by the royal governor at his discretion, he himself holding
at the king’s will.</p>

<p class='c012'>The deepest reaching provision of the acts was aimed at the
town-meetings. They were prohibited, except the annual meeting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>to elect officers, but no other meetings could be held without the
written permission of the royal governor. These acts of parliament
sought to change self-government into government by the king,
and to substitute for home rule, absolute rule at Westminster and St.
James’s palace.</p>

<p class='c012'>Then came the military act, and in February, 1775, parliament
declared Massachusetts in rebellion. The instructions of Lord
Dartmouth, the secretary of state for the colonies, to General Gage,
the royal governor, ran like this: “Sovereignty of the king over the
colonies requires a full and absolute submission.” What a striking
similarity that has to some recent dispatches we have heard since
we acquired distant possessions.</p>

<p class='c012'>General Gage’s call for 20,000 men, the assembling of 5,000 troops
at Boston, and the authority given to General Gage to fire on the people,
made war inevitable. We see again how history repeats itself.</p>

<p class='c012'>The people in spite of royal mandates continued to hold their own
town-meetings, organized county meetings, and made a provincial
congress. The convention at Middlesex “Resolved, if in support
of our rights we are called to encounter death we are yet undaunted,
sensible that he can never die too soon who lays down his life in
support of the laws and liberties of his country.” Lexington wrote
to Boston, “We trust in God that should the state of affairs require
it, we shall be ready to sacrifice our estates and everything dear in
life, yea, and life itself, in support of the common cause.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Nobly did the men of Lexington fulfil that pledge. Shall we in
our day forget what these men did and dared? Are we so saturated
with the spirit of commercialism, are we so wedded to the worship
of the golden calf, that justice and humanity have no place in our
modern code?</p>

<p class='c012'>Let us remember we shall be tried at the bar of history as have
been other nations; as our opportunities have been greater, so are
our responsibilities. We cannot escape our liabilities; it is for us
to so act in the present that this experiment of a free government,
founded upon manhood suffrage, shall not fail.</p>

<p class='c011'>Letters of regret at inability to be present were received from ex-Gov.
John Lee Carroll of Maryland, president of the Sons of the
Revolution; Governor Roosevelt of New York, President Eliot of
Harvard, President Hadley of Yale, Senator Hoar of Massachusetts,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>Senators Hale and Frye of Maine, Senator Mason of Illinois, David
Starr Jordon, president of Leland Stanford University; E. Benjamin
Andrews, superintendent of public schools, Chicago; Congressman
Sulzer of New York, Rector Conaty of the Catholic University,
President Harper of the University of Chicago, Rev. James H.
O’Donnell, Watertown, Conn.; Hon. Thomas J. Lynch, Augusta,
Me.; Hon. James S. Coleman, New York city; Col. John P. Donahoe,
Wilmington, Del.; Mayor Driscoll of New Haven, Conn.; Col.
James Quinlan, New York city; John J. Davis, Greenville, Pa.;
James Connolly, Coronado, Cal.; Col. James Moran, Providence,
R. I., and from several others.</p>

<p class='c012'>Ex-Gov. Carroll of Maryland wrote: “If we contrast the pitiful
resources of those early days with the present happiness, wealth and
prosperity of our united country, we can realize the courage of those
daring men who openly proclaimed that our only purpose was to
obtain our freedom ‘peaceably if we could, forcibly if we must.’”</p>

<p class='c012'>E. Benj. Andrews of Chicago declared: “I assure you that nothing
but my distance from you prevents my attendance. I should be
pleased to attend, not only to hear the distinguished gentlemen who
will be present, but also to testify anew the reverence which all true
patriots must feel for the brave men who immortalized themselves
by standing for liberty on Lexington green, 125 years ago.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Senator Hoar wrote: “It will not be in my power to attend the
celebration of the 19th of April in Boston by the American-Irish
Historical Society. But I am sure that the celebration will be in
the spirit which animated the men who fought and the men who
died on the 19th of April, 1775. You will, I am sure, reinforce the
lesson that no human power can turn wrong into right, injustice
into justice, or lawfully crush out the love of liberty native in every
human soul and the right to independence that belongs to every
people.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Gov. Roosevelt said in his letter: “I wish I could be present
with you at the celebration of the battle of Lexington. It is peculiarly
appropriate for men of Irish stock to take part in this celebration,
for they have always done even more than their proper share
of valiant fighting for the republic.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Congressman Sulzer wrote: “I regret exceedingly my inability
to accept owing to imperative official duties here which demand my
presence in Washington. If ever there was a time in the history of
the republic when we should celebrate the battle of Lexington it is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>this year, and I trust your celebration will be a great success in
every way.”</p>

<p class='c012'>From Congressman Capron of Rhode Island: “I am inclined to
refer to the patriots who fought in the great struggle which initiated
the war for independence and human liberty with the deepest
devotion akin to reverence. The event itself should be held in
grateful remembrance.... Let every American if he would
find the spirit which animated the men of Lexington look down
into his own being and analyze the feelings lying there, and if he be
a true American he will find love of God, love of country, love of
home, love of liberty, love of law and love of man, all and each of
which are the essential components of that which we call patriotism.
My colleague, Mr. Bull, who was also the recipient of your invitation,
desires me to express his thanks therefor and to say that he
heartily joins in the sentiments herein expressed.”</p>

<div class="section"></div>
<h3 class='c007'>PRESIDENT HALL OF CLARK UNIVERSITY.</h3>

<p class='c010'>President G. Stanley Hall of Clark University, Worcester,
Mass., upon being introduced, stated that among his ancestors
was a Mary Hennessy of Limerick, Ireland. He then went on
to say that:</p>

<p class='c011'>The three characteristics of the Irish race, which are most to
be commended when rightly directed, are, first, their heartiness,
geniality, enjoyment of life, a nameless quality made of the best
elements of the German gemuth and the French esprit. This is the
temperament of genius, it is the conserved youth which makes the
Irishman an adolescent at whatever age, and is strongly contrasted
with the sternness and reserve of the Puritan. This temperament,
too, is connected with the fecundity of the race, also in contrast
with the Puritan New Englanders, who even in Boston may ere long
have to hail the Irish race with <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">morituri salutamus</span></i> with a new
meaning in it.</p>

<p class='c012'>Second, the Irishman, like other men, is not always a man of peace.
His blood is warmer on occasion and his interpretation of the strenuous
life, which makes men loved for the enemies they make, is
another quality which, when rightly trained and directed, is one of
the greatest powers for good in the world. To be angry aright is
almost one of the definitions of education.</p>

<p class='c012'>Third, the Irishman has a veritable genius for politics, which had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>no scope in the earlier formative days of Irish history, but which
finds its legitimate sphere in this republican land. He is also a
patriot, a superb soldier. Politics culminates in statesmanship, and
I cannot forbear here a word which I believe will appeal to every
heart which keeps a warm corner for Burke, Emmet or O’Connell.</p>

<p class='c012'>My conception of statesmanship is higher than that of politics.
The first of all conditions of success in its purer realm is utter disinterestedness.
Within the last few days, this country has witnessed
the rare spectacle of a senator,<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c016'><sup>[1]</sup></a> unusually devoted to the party at
whose birth he assisted, and to a president whom he has long loved,
placing his convictions, matured by long experience and ripe knowledge,
above both. To no temperament could the personal sacrifices
have been greater than for him to give us this modern version of
Aristotle’s “<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Plato amicus sed major amicus veritas</span></i>.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Bound by family lineage, many and long friendships, historical
and literary associations, with England, his devotion to our national
muse of liberty which inspired the constitution and the declaration
of independence impelled him to openly declare sympathy toward
the struggling patriots in the Transvaal, as in his long life he has
had occasion to do for Poland, Hungary, Greece, Cuba and Ireland.</p>

<p class='c012'>Gentlemen, there is a higher plane than that of the traditions,
current methods and policies of organizing colonial dependencies.
It is to believe that every growing race and ethnic stock has higher
possibilities in it; to hold that the diverse ways of civilization are
not all exhausted yet, and that instead of forcing other races to take
up the white man’s, or the Englishman’s burden, our policy should
be to keep off, where practicable, alien interference, including our
own, and to develop a new policy of protection and thus to foster
new and independent centers of social and political development.</p>

<p class='c012'>To my mind the tragedy of history is the perversion, repression
or destruction of budding nationalities of species, and perhaps genera,
different from our own, and the threatened uniformitization of
the entire world by civilization as we define and understand it. This
is the method of what, I think, we may call the higher anthropology.
It would be, I think, the statesmanship of the superman, who may
sometime exist, and who would be a citizen of all times and a spectator
of all events. To steer the ship of state in this direction is to
keep it true to the pole of human destiny. It is the work of the heavenborn
pilot, who keeps his tiller true, and not of the star gazer.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>These moments are big with destiny. Statesmanship is approaching
the time when it must take a cosmic view of human life as a
whole, and I have heard no note that rings so clear and pure to my
ear with such a true flavor of conviction as the plea for a larger ken
by the political nestor of this state and nation, who has grown not
rich but poor from a quarter century’s service for his state; who
makes no bid for the support of other parties, while speaking as
many of his colleagues in both parties privately declare they would
do if they spoke for themselves rather than for their constituency; a
man competent to-day to fill any one of three if not four professorships;
whose years admonish us that any such utterance may be his
last, and whom, as in the case of no other public man, his political
enemies vie with his friends to honor.</p>

<p class='c010'>President Hall was followed by President Capen of Tufts
College who also delivered an entertaining address.</p>

<p class='c006'>The historical paper of the evening was by Thomas F.
O’Malley, of Somerville, Mass., whose subject was “Hugh
Cargill,” a patriot who took part in the events of April 19,
1775. The paper displayed close research.</p>

<p class='c006'>There were also addresses during the evening by John E.
Milholland, Joseph Smith and E. O’Meagher Condon.</p>

<p>GEN. RICHARD MONTGOMERY.<br /><br />Born near Raphoe, Donegal County, Ireland, 1736; became a distinguished American soldier; was appointed a brigadier-general by the Continental Congress: acting commander-in-chief of the Northern Department; invaded Canada; captured St. John, took Montreal, and laid siege to Quebec; was promoted to the rank of major-general; killed, on Dec. 31, 1775, while attempting to carry Quebec by storm. Hon. John D. Crimmins, President-General of the American-Irish Historical Society, has the last letter that Montgomery is known to have written. It is a demand on the British commander of Quebec to surrender.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>THE ANNIVERSARY IS DULY OBSERVED BY THE SOCIETY—A WREATH PLACED.</h3>

<p class='c010'>On June 18, 1900, the Society celebrated the anniversary of
the battle of Bunker Hill, the following being a copy of the

<p class='c010'>In accordance with the foregoing notice, a number of members
of the Society assembled at the memorial tablets, in
Charlestown, at noon, and witnessed the placing of a laurel
wreath to the memory of the patriots of June 17.</p>

<p class='c006'>Upon the wreath being placed in position, a card bearing the
following inscription was attached thereto:</p>

  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c006'>Thomas F. O’Malley then addressed the gathering substantially
as follows:</p>

<p class='c011'>To-day we meet in pious and patriotic commemoration of a great
deed, performed here 125 years ago. To-day we stand in the midst
of a great nation which is proud, strong and free. All is joy around
us. But let us turn back a century and a quarter in the book of time.
What a scene was enacted here! The hill crowned with a hastily
constructed redoubt and held by an undisciplined and untrained
yeomanry—farmers, with their fowling pieces and but little ammunition.</p>

<p class='c012'>A brilliantly appointed army advancing to the attack and
storming the works, supported by coöperating ships and batteries;
the blaze of the burning town, coursing whole streets or curling up
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>the spires of public edifices; the air above filled with clouds of
dense black smoke, and the surrounding hills, fields, roofs and
steeples occupied by crowds of spectators. What strange sounds
came to the ear—the shouts of the contending armies, the crash of
falling buildings, the roar of ship guns and mortars and the rattle of
musketry.</p>

<p class='c012'>On one side we find the high courage of men staking their lives
and reputations on the uncertain issue of a civil war; and on the
other, the reflection that defeat meant the final loss to Britain of her
American empire.</p>

<p class='c012'>You know the story of that battle—how the flower of England’s
army were repeatedly repulsed; how in the moment of desperation the
regulars laid aside their knapsacks, moved forward, relying on the
bayonet and their artillery to carry the day. The American fire
slackened, the ammunition was expended, there were no bayonets,
and the oncoming regulars were met with clubbed muskets and
stones. The fortunes of the day were reversed, and, technically
speaking, it was a British victory.</p>

<p class='c010'>After speaking of the men of Irish blood who fought in the
patriot ranks that day, Mr. O’Malley continued:</p>

<p class='c011'>The Americans are estimated to have lost in killed 140, and in
wounded 271; loss by capture 30. In all, 441. The English loss
was 226 killed, 828 wounded. Total—1,054.</p>

<p class='c012'>In comparison with other battles, so far as numbers go, Bunker
Hill was but a skirmish. But in results it was of the utmost importance.
Before the engagement there was some hope, perhaps some
chance, for a peaceful settlement of existing difficulties; but after
that memorable day, all were for war and independence. Bunker
Hill was the beginning of the end of British domination on the
Western continent.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mr. O’Malley was frequently applauded and upon the conclusion
of his address was warmly congratulated. The banquet
at the United States Hotel in the evening was a most enjoyable
affair.</p>

<p class='c006'>President-General Gargan occupied the chair. Among those
present were Hon. John C. Linehan, treasurer-general of the
Society, Concord, N. H.; Secretary-General T. H. Murray,
Woonsocket, R. I.; William Doogue, city forester of Boston;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>Thomas F. O’Malley, the orator at the memorial tablets;
Joseph Smith, Lowell, Mass.; James Jeffrey Roche, Boston;
William P. Connery, Lynn, Mass.; M. E. Hennessy, Boston;
Capt. Samuel McKeever, U. S. A. (retired), Somerville, Mass.;
E. O’Meagher Condon, New York city; John T. F. MacDonnell,
Holyoke, Mass., and others.</p>

<p class='c006'>President-General Gargan said in his after-dinner address:</p>

<p class='c011'>One hundred and twenty-five years have passed since the memorable
battle of Bunker Hill, commemorated by yonder tall gray
shaft at Charlestown, familiar to us all from early boyhood. We
knew the story of that fight before we knew the multiplication table.
Nominally a British victory, yet a victory purchased at such fearful
cost to the victors as to inspire the colonists to believe that ultimately
the triumph would be theirs.</p>

<p class='c012'>We all know the story from the American standpoint; few read
the British accounts of that battle. I was interested to read, a few
days ago, some of the English accounts; one of them concludes in
these words:</p>

<p class='c012'>“The action has shown the bravery of the king’s troops, who,
under every disadvantage, gained a complete victory over three
times their number strongly posted and covered by breastworks, but
they fought for their king, their law and constitution.”</p>

<p class='c012'>That sounds like the account some of the emasculated Americans
in our day would give of the fight. But Gage wrote to Lord Dartmouth,
then minister for the colonies:</p>

<p class='c012'>“The number of killed and wounded is greater than we could
afford to lose. The trials we have had show that the rebels are not
the despicable rabble too many may have supposed them to be.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Burgoyne and Clinton, who saw the battle from Copp’s Hill, have
also written their impressions of the battle in 1775. There were
two English accounts, historical in their nature. One of these, it is
thought, was written by Edmund Burke, and was published in the
Annual Register of that year.</p>

<p class='c012'>To all Americans, Bunker Hill was a battle cry and an inspiration
during the seven long years of war necessary to obtain our independence.
To-day its memories should rekindle our patriotism and
prompt us to recall the story of the men who there died that a new
republic might be born. We know that they believed in God and
had high ideals.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>The historical paper of the evening was by Hon. John C.
Linehan and was of a high order of merit.</p>

<p class='c006'>Brief addresses were made by Capt. Samuel McKeever,
U. S. A., and by several other gentlemen present, and the company
adjourned, well pleased with the celebration of the day
and evening.</p>

<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>Island, President Faunce of Brown University, R. H. Tilley,
state record commissioner of Rhode Island; Hon. John C.

<p class='c006'>The following letter, which had just been received by Secretary
T. H. Murray, aroused special interest when read to the
assembled company:</p>

<div  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/i_049.jpg' alt='DAUGHTERS OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>My Dear Mr. Murray</span>:</p>

<p class='c012'>Mr. R. H. Tilley has advised me to write you, as a valuable man
to interest in a project which should be of interest to every loyal
Rhode Islander.</p>

<p class='c012'>The old historic fort on Butts Hill in Portsmouth is being surveyed
with the idea of selling in small lots, and thus totally obliterating
the fort where General Sullivan and his troops fought so
well and so bravely. Does it not seem as if this spot should be preserved
if possible? I believe a bill was introduced into the legislature
some time ago, making this fort a state park, but nothing has
since been heard of it, so far as I can find out.</p>

<p class='c012'>Miss Swinburne, regent of William Ellery Chapter, D. A. R., and
I are very desirous of rousing among the patriotic societies a sufficient
interest to save this well-preserved relic of Revolutionary days.
It seems a peculiarly fitting season to begin the agitation, and I
hope that some of the speakers on Wednesday, both at the celebration
by your own Historical Society and also at the meeting of the
Sons of the Revolution on the same day, may feel inclined to call
attention to this subject.</p>

<p class='c012'>I talked with Mr. Tilley<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c016'><sup>[2]</sup></a> yesterday and found him as kindly disposed
to help as I could desire, and he has promised to add his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>word in support of my request whenever he may chance to see you.
I can answer for my own Gaspee Chapter, D. A. R., if our assistance
is needed, but with such influence as you could wield, coöperating
with the S. A. R and S. R. of the state, I feel very hopeful of success
in our patriotic project.</p>

<p class='c012'>I do not feel as if I had at all adequately presented my case, but
it is very hard to condense all that might be said on such a subject
into the limits of a reasonable note. I hope you will recognize my
endeavor to save your valuable time, and read into my words an
enthusiastic interest which I have not expressed.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Dear Sir</span>:</p>

<p class='c012'>At the meeting of the Irish patriotic society to be held on

it be possible to bring up the subject of the old fortifications on
Butts Hill and call attention to the danger which threatens them,
namely, their destruction?</p>

<p class='c012'>Few such spots remain on this island, and is it not the duty as
well as privilege of all loyal patriots to help preserve such spots

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>I hope this may receive your support and that you will consider
it of sufficient importance to bring before your society.</p>

<p class='c010'>Butts Hill, to which Mrs. Lippitt and Miss Swinburne refer,
is in Portsmouth, R. I. The fortifications alluded to were constructed
by Gen. John Sullivan in 1778, in connection with the
siege of Newport and the subsequent battle on Rhode Island.</p>

<p class='c006'>The meeting expressed itself as heartily in favor of the project
mentioned in the two letters and referred the subject-matter
to the executive council of the Society.</p>

<p class='c006'>On the same evening that this celebration of the battle anniversary
was being held by our members at the Aquidneck,
another celebration of the anniversary was taking place at the
Newport Casino, under the auspices of the Newport Sons of
the Revolution.</p>

<p class='c006'>During the evening, greetings were sent by the Sons assembled
at the Casino to our members at the Aquidneck. Messrs.
Sanborn and Garrettson of Newport, and Lieutenant Commander
Murdock, U. S. N., were delegated to proceed to the
Aquidneck and present our members a handsome floral tribute.
The presentation speech was made by Mr. Garrettson, and the
tribute was accepted, on behalf of our Society, by Mayor
Boyle. Later, several of our members accepted an invitation
from the Sons to be their guests, and proceeded to the Casino,
where they were warmly greeted and hospitably entertained.</p>

<p class='c006'>John P. Sanborn of the Sons, who was then presiding, paid
a glowing tribute to Gen. John Sullivan and to the Irish element,
generally, in American history. While at the Casino,
several of our members were called on for remarks and
responded. Thus Mayor Boyle made a brief address, as did
Mayor Driscoll of New Haven, Conn. John J. Rooney
of New York recited a patriotic poem, and Hon. James F.
Brennan of Peterborough, N. H., spoke eloquently of the
services of General Sullivan.</p>

  <h2 id='REV' class='c004'>REV. JAMES MAC SPARRAN, IRISHMAN, SCHOLAR, PREACHER AND PHILOSOPHER, 1680‒1757.</h2>
</div>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div><span class='small'>BY THOMAS HAMILTON MURRAY.<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c016'><sup>[4]</sup></a></span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Rev. James MacSparran was one of the great men given by
Ireland to Rhode Island in the early half of the eighteenth century.
For nearly forty years he was rector of St. Paul’s church,<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c016'><sup>[5]</sup></a> in
Narragansett, R. I., and forms one of the grand figures in Rhode
Island history.</p>

<p class='c006'>He was born in or near Dungiven, Londonderry, Ireland, about
the year 1680. He received the degree of M. A. from Glasgow
University in 1709, and that of D. D., from Oxford in 1731. He
belonged to a Presbyterian family. His first visit within the present
territory of Rhode Island was made about 1718.</p>

<p class='c006'>He came from Boston to Bristol, then a part of Massachusetts,
and stopped during his visit at the house of a relative, the Widow
Pompelion, who resided at the corner of Hope and State streets.
Possessing credentials as a licentiate, he preached in Bristol and
was favorably received. Munro thus narrates<a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c016'><sup>[6]</sup></a> the incident:</p>

<p class='c006'>“The pulpit was vacant, and the young Irishman was invited to
preach in the meeting house on the Sunday after he reached Bristol.
Mr. M<sup>c</sup>Sparran possessed, in an unusual degree, the remarkable
eloquence with which so many of the children of Ireland have been
endowed, and his wonderful oratory made such a deep impression
upon the minds of his hearers that at a church meeting held on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>16th of December, 1718, he was invited to settle in the town as its
pastor. On the 22d of December the town concurred in the church’s
choice, 73 votes being cast for Mr. M<sup>c</sup>Sparran and but three
against him.”</p>

<p class='c006'>It was voted that his salary be £100 per year, and £100 was
appropriated toward the expense of his settlement. Thus far matters
had gone along smoothly. Trouble now arose, however.
A date had been fixed for his ordination, but the ministers who were
expected to officiate refused to do so.</p>

<p class='c006'>MacSparran<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c016'><sup>[7]</sup></a> being desirous of a settlement, offered to submit to
lay ordination. In the meantime, Rev. Dr. Mather of Massachusetts
had instituted charges against him. One of these was
“Unguarded conversation.” The matter came before a town-meeting
in May, 1719, and MacSparran was exonerated. Angered by
their defeat, his opponents then questioned the genuineness of his
credentials. In order to give him an opportunity to establish his
standing, the town:</p>

<p class='c006'>“Voted, That leave be granted to Mr. James MacSparran, our
present minister, to take a voyage to Ireland, in order to procure a
confirmation of his credentials, the truth of which being by some
questioned; and that he return to us again some time in June next
ensuing and proceed in the work of the ministry with us, if he procure
the confirmation of the aforesaid credentials.”</p>

<p class='c006'>MacSparran departed, but never returned to that church or denomination.
The harsh and illiberal treatment he had received from
Mather and other zealots displeased him, and soon after he entered
the Church of England, in which he remained until his death.</p>

<p class='c006'>MacSparran came to these parts again in 1721, this time as a
Church of England missionary. He began his ministerial labors at
St. Paul’s church in Narragansett (Kingstown, R. I.), and had charge
of that colonial parish until his death in 1757. The settlers in that
neighborhood had been visited by two ministers previous to Dr.
MacSparran’s coming, but, as he declares, “they lacked resolution to
grapple with the difficulties of the mission above a year apiece.”</p>

<p class='c006'>MacSparran married Miss Hannah Gardiner, daughter of William
Gardiner, on May 22, 1722. The ceremony was performed in St.
Paul’s church, Narragansett, by Rev. Samuel Honeyman, who had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>gone from Newport for the purpose. Dr. MacSparran was proud to
be known as an Irishman. He could write and speak the Irish
language, and always had a great affection for his native land. He
was a kindly, noble-hearted man, and could, when occasion required,
eloquently defend his Roman Catholic fellow-countrymen.</p>

<p class='c006'>His very interesting work, “America Dissected,” was published at
Dublin in 1753. It gives us a good idea of the extent of Irish
immigration and of other matters in the colonies at that time. The
work comprises letters addressed by Dr. MacSparran from Narragansett
“in the colony of Rhode Island” to friends in Ireland.
Here are extracts from one written by him to Col. Henry Cary,
under date of August, 1752:</p>

<p class='c006'>“There has lately been made, upon and behind the mountains of
Virginia, a new Irish settlement, by a transmigration of sundry of
those that, within these thirty years past, went from the north of
Ireland to Pennsylvania. As the soil in that new Irish settlement is
natural and friendly to grass, they will for many years to come raise
great quantities of neat cattle.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Writing of Maryland he says: “As the late Lord Baltimore was
the first Protestant peer of the Calvert family, his predecessors (as it
was natural they should) first peopled this province with a colony of
Irish Catholics.... There are some Quakers here, in consequence
of its bordering on Pennsylvania, and some Irish Presbyterians,
owing to the swarms that, for many years past, have winged
their way westward out of the great Hibernian hive.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Again referring to Pennsylvania, Dr. MacSparran writes: “The
Irish are numerous in this province, who, besides their interspersions
among the English and others, have peopled a whole county
by themselves, called the county of <i>Donnegal</i>, with many other new
out-towns and districts. In one of these frontiers, on the forks of
Delaware, I assisted my brother (who left Ireland against my advice)
in purchasing a large tract of land, which by his wife’s demise,
above a year ago, descends to his children. The exportations from
this province are principally wheaten flour, which they send abroad
in great quantities; and by the accessions and industry of the Irish
and Germans, they threaten, in a few years, to lessen the American
demands for Irish and other European linens.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Alluding to New Hampshire he continues: “In this province lies
that town called London-Derry, all Irish, and famed for industry
and riches.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>Then, leaving New Hampshire, he continues: “Next you enter
Main,<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c016'><sup>[8]</sup></a> which in its civilized government, is annexed to the Massachusetts,
as Sagadahock also is; and both rather by use than right.
In these two eastern provinces many Irish are settled, and many
have been ruined by the French Indians and drove from their
homes. It is pretty true to observe of the Irish,<a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c016'><sup>[9]</sup></a> that those who
come here with any wealth, are the worse for their removal; though,
doubtless, the next generation will not suffer so much as their
fathers; but those who, when they came, had nothing to lose, have
throve greatly by their labour.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Dr. MacSparran’s reference to Rhode Island is of particular interest.
He writes of it as follows:  “... the little colony of
Rhode Island, etc., where Providence has fixed me, and where I
have resided in quality of missionary thirty-one years last April....
This little district extends itself no more than forty miles
in length, and thirty in breadth, or it may be forty [for I write to
you, sir, from memory]. It contains 1,024,000 acres, and is peopled
with about 30,000 inhabitants, young and old, white and black....
In 1700, after Quakerism and other heresies had, in their
turn, ruled and tinged all the inhabitants for the space of forty-six
years, the Church of England, that had been lost here through the
neglect of the crown, entered, as it were, unobserved and unseen,
and yet not without some success.</p>

<p class='c006'>“A little church was built in Newport, the metropolis of the colony,
in 1702, and that in which I officiate in Narragansett, in 1707....
I entered on this mission in 1721, and found the people
not a ... clean sheet of paper, upon which I might make
any impressions I pleased; but a field full of briars and thorns, and
noxious weeds, that were all to be eradicated, before I could implant
in them the simplicity of truth. By my excursions and out labours,
a church is built 25 miles to the westward of me, but not now
under my care; another 16 miles to the northward of me, where
I officiate once a month; and at a place six miles further off, on
the Saturday before that monthly Sunday. I gathered a congregation
at a place called New Bristol, where now officiates a missionary
from the Society, and I was the first Episcopal minister that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>ever preached at Providence, where, for a long time, I used to go
four times a year, but that church has now a fixed missionary of its
own.”</p>

<p class='c006'>In another place he tells us: “There are above three hundred
vessels, such as sloops, schooners, brigantines, and ships, from sixty
tons and upwards, that belong to this colony, and they are carriers
for other colonies.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The church of St. Paul was built in 1707. When Kingstown was
divided, in 1722, into the towns of North and South Kingstown,
the church became located about a mile over the line in the former
place. In 1791 it was incorporated as St. Paul’s church in North
Kingstown. In 1800 the building was removed to Wickford and
the parish divided.</p>

<p class='c006'>Dr. MacSparran was for nearly four decades closely identified with
the highest social and intellectual life of the colony. His scholarly
attainments made him the centre of a group<a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c016'><sup>[10]</sup></a> of cultivated minds.
As pastor of St. Paul’s church, he ministered to many of the leading
families in Rhode Island. He officiated at their weddings, administered
baptism, preached the gospel according to his convictions,
and when loved ones died uttered sweet words of condolence, sympathy
and hope.</p>

<p class='c006'>The church records contain such leading names as Updike,
Arnold, Lippitt, Gardiner, Helme, Wilkinson, Potter, Robinson and
a large number of others.</p>

<p class='c006'>But “Parson” MacSparran, as he was lovingly called, was not
alone the friend and associate of the well-to-do. His love for the
poor and lowly was unbounded, and this sympathy found ample
reciprocation in the hearts of the humble.</p>

<p class='c006'>In order to understand the general character of Narragansett
society at that period a few words may be necessary. Amos Perry<a id='r11' /><a href='#f11' class='c016'><sup>[11]</sup></a>
says: “The honor of being, par excellence, the Narragansett
country is generally conceded to Charlestown and the original
‘Kings Towne,’ whose united area is 19.8 per cent. of that of the
entire state.” To make it plainer, it should be said that the
“Narragansett country” comprised that portion of the state of
Rhode Island now known as Washington county. It was so called
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>because it was the seat of the Narragansett Indians.<a id='r12' /><a href='#f12' class='c016'><sup>[12]</sup></a> In 1654 it
was named King’s Province, which in 1729 was changed to King’s
county. In 1781 that monarchical designation was dropped and
the name Washington substituted.</p>

<p class='c006'>The county now comprises the towns of Charlestown, Exeter,
Hopkinton, North Kingstown, South Kingstown, Richmond, and
Westerly. The “Narragansett country” had long existed as an
independent jurisdiction. Finally, the king in council promulgated
his decision uniting the “King’s Province or Narragansett” to
Rhode Island. For long years after, the name “Narragansett
country” was still affectionately retained in the nomenclature of
that district. In Dr. MacSparran’s time there were numbers of
wealthy landholders in Narragansett. Many of these owned thousands
of acres each and had great herds of cattle and flocks of
sheep. Many, too, were slave owners and slave dealers. As late as
1804, Rhode Island had fifty-nine vessels engaged in the slave
trade, notwithstanding an act was passed in 1787 forbidding the
traffic.<a id='r13' /><a href='#f13' class='c016'><sup>[13]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>For a long period the slaves were practically barred out of the
church. They were neither instructed, baptized, nor admitted to
the communion. To bestow such favors upon them was considered
inconsistent by their masters. But MacSparran, the great-hearted
Irishman, combated this error. He emphatically protested against
this unchristian exclusion of the slaves and ultimately prevailed in
their behalf.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Narragansett landholders and their families lived in princely
style on their vast estates. They were a hospitable race, cordial in
their welcomes, warm and lasting in their attachments. Fond of
horse racing, they raised a breed known as “Narragansett Pacers,”
which became famous throughout the country. Fox-hunting was
also a favorite sport.</p>

<p class='c006'>The glebe house occupied by Dr. MacSparran for over thirty years
is yet standing. It overlooks the Pettaquamscutt river. This river
is really a connected series of pretty lakes. Mr. Hazard once
termed them the “Killarneys of New England.” Dr. MacSparran
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>taught many pupils at his home, imparting a knowledge of the
Greek and Latin classics and various other branches. Writing in
1752, he says: “Mr. Thomas Clap, president of Yale college, was
my scholar when I came first to these parts, and on all occasions
gratefully acknowledges his receiving the first rudiments of his
learning from me, who, by the way, have not but a modicum to
boast of myself.” Dr. MacSparran has left this significant entry:
“In Bristol, New England, February 5th, 1722, were imprisoned in
jail twelve men of the Church of England for refusing to pay for the
support of the Presbyterian teacher, viz.: Mr. Nathaniel Cotton.”
Others were imprisoned in 1724 for a like offense, and Dr. MacSparran
says: “I have inserted this line in the church records, that the
age to come may not forget the opposing spirit of New England
Presbyterians.” The following extracts from the records of St.
Paul’s church may prove of interest:</p>

<p class='c006'>“July 11, 1721, four children were baptized at Providence, viz.:
Mary Bernon, and Eva Bernon, Anna Donnison, and Elizabeth
Donnison, by Rev. Mr. McSparran.</p>

<p class='c006'>“November 8th, 1724. Captain Benoni Sweet was baptized at
St. Paul’s, in Narragansett, by the Rev. Mr. McSparran.</p>

<p class='c006'>“April 22d, 1730. In Westerly, Narragansett, Christopher Champlin
and Hannah Hill, daughter of Captain John Hill, were joined
together in holy matrimony by the Rev. Mr. McSparran, at the
house of the said Captain John Hill.</p>

<p class='c006'>“May 2d, 1730. Daniel Updike, Attorney-General of the Colony
and Lieutenant-Colonel of the militia of the Islands, was baptized
by immersion (in Petaquamscut river) by the Rev. Mr.
McSparran, in presence of Mr. McSparran, Hannah McSparran, his
wife, and Josiah Arnold, church warden, as witnesses.</p>

<p class='c006'>“December 11th, 1735. Dr. Giles Goddard<a id='r14' /><a href='#f14' class='c016'><sup>[14]</sup></a> of Groton, in Connecticut,
was married to Miss Sarah Updike, at the house of her
father, Captain Lodowick Updike, by Mr. McSparran.</p>

<p class='c006'>“August 6, 1747. Dr. McSparran baptized Mrs. Elizabeth Wilkinson,
wife of Capt. Philip Wilkinson,<a id='r15' /><a href='#f15' class='c016'><sup>[15]</sup></a> by immersion in Petaquamscut
pond. Witnesses, the Doctor, his wife, and Mrs. Coddington.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Sept. 6th, Thursday, 1750. The bans of marriage being duly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>published at the church of St. Paul’s, in Narragansett, no objections
being made, John Anthony, an Indian man, was married to Sarah
George, an Indian woman, the widow and Dowager Queen of
Geo. Augustus Ninegret, deceased, by Dr. McSparran.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Nov. 18, 1750. Sunday, the banns being first duly asked, at
St. Paul’s, Dr. McSparran married William Potter, youngest son of
Col. John Potter, to Penelope Hazard, eldest daughter of Col.
Thomas Hazard, both of South Kingstown, at Col. Thomas Hazard’s
house.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Nov. 7, 1752. Dr. McSparran, at the house of Colonel Thomas
Hazard, on Boston Neck,<a id='r16' /><a href='#f16' class='c016'><sup>[16]</sup></a> married George Hazard (son of George,
the son of old Thomas Hazard) to Sarah Hazard, the third daughter
of said Colonel Hazard.</p>

<p class='c006'>“April 11th, 1756, being Palm Sunday, Doctor McSparran read
prayers, preached, and baptized a child named Gilbert Stewart,<a id='r17' /><a href='#f17' class='c016'><sup>[17]</sup></a> son
of Gilbert Stewart, the snuff-grinder. Sureties, the Doctor, Mr.
Benjamin Mumford, and Mrs. Hannah Mumford.”</p>

<p class='c006'>In 1741‒2, MacSparran in a letter to the Society for the Propagation
of the Gospel in Foreign Parts, writes that in the middle arm
of the sea, which divides the island of Rhode Island from the Narragansett
shore, lies an island called Conanicut, “about eight or
nine miles long, and two wide, containing about four or five hundred
inhabitants, who had never had Christianity preached to them
in any shape than Quakerism,” until he addressed them upon
express invitation. He was so pleased with his first visit to the
island that he determined to repeat the visit monthly. In the
course of his letters he expresses the wish that Ireland was at liberty
to send the colonies her woolens instead of her linens, “which
will soon cease to be in demand here.”</p>

<p class='c006'>MacSparran was unalterably opposed, in season and out of season,
to all efforts to form a legislative union between England and Ireland.
He gives expression to his sentiments on this point, in a
letter to Ireland,<a id='r18' /><a href='#f18' class='c016'><sup>[18]</sup></a> wherein he declares:</p>

<p class='c006'>“Our attention has for some time been taken up with the news
of measures on foot to unite Ireland to England, as Scotland is.
I pray God they may never take effect; for if they do, farewell
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>liberty. You are greater slaves already than our negroes, and an
union of that kind would make you more underlings than you are
now. The accounts of the open irreligion of the greater island
inclines me to imagine, that Ireland is on the brink of obtaining (as
if these accounts are true, it deserves), its ancient name of Insula
Sanctorum. But if ever you come into a closer connection with
the more eastern island, corruption will increase.... I suppose
those that are sent to rule with you, like those who sometimes
are sent here, imagine fleecing to be a better business than feeding
the flock. The revolution which happened before you and I were
born, might be thought a wise and necessary measure, but we see it
has been followed with some bad consequences. To get free from
Popery, we have run into infidelity and scepticism.... Except
the little revival religion had in Queen Ann’s reign, the church has
gained no ground, but in America, since that period.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Dr. MacSparran, in a letter addressed<a id='r19' /><a href='#f19' class='c016'><sup>[19]</sup></a> to a friend in Ireland under
date of 1752, again refers to Rhode Island, saying: “There are
here, which is no good symptom, a vast many law suits, more in one
year than the county of Derry has in twenty ... and Billy
McEvers has been so long your father’s and your honor’s constable,
that he would make a very good figure on the bench of our courts
of sessions and of common pleas, and no contemptible one on those
of our courts of assize and general gaol delivery.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Writing to his friend William Stevenson, in Ireland, Aug. 21,
1752, MacSparran informs him that “My brother and his wife died
a year ago last June.... I have to go for England for ten or
twelve months, to go to the baths for better health; if I can bring
matters to bear to get to England, my next push will be to be seated
in Ireland.... I am in the hands of a good God, who has the
hearts of men at command; and if he sees that I can serve the
interests of Christ’s church, either in the use of the English or Irish
language, which you know I can write and read, and upon occasion
could preach in, He will raise me up friends, and restore me to my
native land, or near it—if not, His will be done.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Dr. MacSparran’s brother, whom he mentions, Archibald, sailed
from Ireland for Rhode Island, but the ship made another port and
he settled near New Castle on Delaware bay. He had seven children:
Margaret, Eliza, Bridget, John, James, Archibald, and Joseph.
Dr. MacSparran, as I have said, had no children. The Doctor and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>his wife went to England sometime before 1755. She died there in
the latter year.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Doctor returned to Rhode Island and made pastoral visits
to Providence, Warwick and several other places. In 1757 he died.<a id='r20' /><a href='#f20' class='c016'><sup>[20]</sup></a>
The manner of his death was a little remarkable. It is thus described
in papers in the possession of the Updike family:</p>

<p class='c006'>“Dr. MacSparran caught his death at father’s. He went to
prayer, and had read and was going to kneel, and being a fat, heavy
man, and putting his hands on the table to ease himself down, the
table split off and his weight came down and he hit the edge of his
eyebrow against the sharp edge of the table leg and he bled profusely—but
he would have nothing done till he had finished his
prayer. They bound it up and he got home and never recovered.”</p>

<p class='c006'>He was buried under the communion table of St. Paul’s. In
1781 his successor, Rev. Samuel Fayerweather, was laid beside him.
It is believed that Dr. MacSparran had written a history of Narragansett,
but the manuscript was not found after his death. It may
have previously been sent to Ireland. He bequeathed his house
and farm to church purposes and the property became a glebe for
the rectors of St. Paul’s.</p>

<p class='c006'>Sometime previous to his death he sent his diplomas as Master
and Doctor to Rev. Paul Limrick, a cousin in Ireland, requesting
the latter to have them registered in the parish registry of Dungiven.
He asked to have this done “not through vanity, but being a pilgrim
on earth and not knowing but my <i>carcase</i> may fall in a strange
land, it would be pleasing to me that my relations in time to come
might be able to speak of me with authority.”</p>

  <h2 id='MEN' class='c004'>MEN OF IRISH BLOOD WHO HAVE ATTAINED DISTINCTION IN AMERICAN JOURNALISM.</h2>

<p class='c005'>In journalism, as in every other walk of life, men of Irish blood
are, and have been, leaders of those who mould public opinion. As
American newspaper men, Irish-Americans have added new laurels
to the fair name of Erin’s sons. Irish in name, their intense Americanism
pervades every cosmopolitan journal from the Atlantic to the
Pacific and from the Canadian line to the Gulf of Mexico.</p>

<p class='c006'>Irishmen were among the pioneers in the establishment of the
early American newspapers. It would, indeed, be interesting to follow
one by one, step by step, the career of the men of Irish blood
who, more than a hundred years ago, braved blind prejudice and
established newspapers which did so much for American freedom,
and later labored so hard for internal improvements, the developing
and the upbuilding of the great Republic.</p>

<p class='c006'>Irishmen were among the first paper manufacturers in this country.
Many of them, prior to the Revolutionary War, were engaged
in the printing business. Naturally they drifted into publishing
newspapers. At the period immediately following the Revolution,
it is estimated by the census bureau that there were published in the
United States two hundred papers. Of these, it is said, twenty-five
were controlled by foreigners, and were, as a rule, the most influential
papers published, and were issued in the large towns like Philadelphia,
New York and Boston.</p>

<p class='c006'>The election of John Adams as president, and the inauguration of
his federal policy, brought into being a strong opposition press,
which arrayed itself on the side of Thomas Jefferson. The editors
of that period, not unlike the politicians of their time, did not mince
matters. Their trenchant quills smote the Federalists with such
force that the administration of Mr. Adams deemed it necessary to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>pass a law that would curb the spirit of the times and muzzle the
opposition press. The result was the enactment of the Alien and
Sedition act. The twenty-five papers which were controlled by the
foreigners were the special mark of the alien and sedition laws.</p>

<p class='c006'>Appleton’s Encyclopedia, speaking on this subject, says:</p>

<p class='c006'>“The apology for the sedition act was the unquestionable licentiousness
of the press, which, at that time, was chiefly controlled by
refugees and adventurists from Great Britain and Ireland.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Lossing, in his United States History, says, “that outside of New
England, the most influential papers were controlled principally by
foreigners.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The majority of the refugees and adventurists, so called, were
men of Irish blood; all of them men of learning, enterprise and
push. They hated the Federalists for their pro-English leanings,
especially President Adams, whom they believed to be friendly to
England in the contest against France. Several of them had had a
taste of British tyranny at home, and all were imbued with the spirit
of ’98.</p>

<p class='c006'>Among the very earliest newspaper enterprises was that of Hugh
Gaine in New York city. Gaine was a native of Ireland. He began
his new world career as a book-seller. In 1752 he commenced
the publication of the <cite>Mercury</cite>. Hudson, in his history of journalism
in the United States, says of the paper, that it was one of the
best in all the colonies in the collection of intelligence. Hugh
Gaine prospered as an editor, book-seller and publisher.</p>

<p class='c006'>How noble was the attitude of Charles Carroll, of Carrollton, who
lent his mighty influence to launching the <cite>Maryland Gazette</cite>. His
financial and moral aid made possible its vigorous contest for the
freedom of the colonies.</p>

<p class='c006'>The alien and sedition act was particularly aimed at the Irishmen,
who, almost to a man, arrayed themselves under the broad banner
of Jefferson, the leader of the Republicans. The first man to suffer
under the alien and sedition laws was an Irishman, Congressman
Matthew Lyon of Vermont, a native of Wicklow, a printer, who
started the <cite>Farmer’s Library</cite>, and later issued the <cite>Fairhaven Gazette</cite>.
This “peppery, red-headed little Irishman,” as he was called by his
contemporaries, hated everything that had the odor of Federalism
about it, and for an article written by him, published in a Vermont
paper, reflecting on President John Adams, he was indicted by the
United States Court. A writer, speaking of the article for which he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>was indicted, says that “the language was decidedly Lyonesque.”
He was fined $1,000 and imprisoned for three months. While in
jail he was reëlected to congress, and on his release would have
been rearrested on another charge under the same act, had he not
availed himself of his constitutional rights and declared that he was
on his way to Philadelphia to attend a sitting of Congress.</p>

<p class='c006'>Lyon is remembered for his varied congressional life, and the episode
especially with Congressman Griswold of Connecticut. Griswold
referred to Lyon deprecatingly one day, and revived an old
story of alleged cowardice during the Revolutionary War, which his
political opponents used against him. The result was an exhibition
of old-time pugilism on the floor of congress. For this offence
an attempt was made to expel him from the house on two occasions,
but each time it failed for want of a two-thirds vote.</p>

<p class='c006'>Lyon had the distinguished honor of having been elected as a
representative from three states to congress,—Vermont, Kentucky
and Arkansas. He learned the trade of a printer when a boy, ran
away from the old country and settled in Vermont. Governor Chittenden
took a great interest in the young Irish lad, and helped him
in many ways. He married a daughter of the governor’s, and engaged
in the manufacture of iron and paper. Becoming involved
financially, in trying to build a flotilla of gunboats on the Delaware
for the infant American navy, he moved to Kentucky, and
there set up another printing office, the first in the state. He was
elected to Congress in 1804, serving until 1810.</p>

<p class='c006'>He was the first delegate to Congress from Arkansas, having
taken up his residence in Little Rock, but he died before taking his
seat. To Matthew Lyon also belongs the distinguished honor of
having cast the vote of Vermont for Jefferson for president against
Adams in that critical period of American history, when the choice
of president was thrown into the house of representatives.</p>

<p class='c006'>His son, Chittenden, was a prominent man of his day, a member
of congress, and took an active part in public affairs. In 1840 congress
refunded Matthew Lyon’s son the $1,000 fine imposed upon
his father under the alien and sedition act.</p>

<p class='c006'>In Massachusetts, Attorney-General James Sullivan, afterward
congressman and governor, the son of Irish emigrants, wrote and
published a most able paper entitled, “A Dissertation on the Constitutional
Freedom of the Press,” severely arraigning the sedition
law. After enumerating the power of congress, Mr. Sullivan said:</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>“It is very clear that, considering a libel as a private injury, the
congress can have no authority to enact a law for its definition or
punishment.... It went beyond what the constitution would
warrant.” In his final summing up, Attorney-General Sullivan said,
“that a reasonable, constitutional restraint, judicially exercised, is
the only way in which the freedom of the press can be preserved as
an invaluable privilege to the nation.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The alien and sedition laws were soon effaced from the statute
books when the Democratic party came into power under Jefferson.
Inasmuch as these laws were aimed especially at the men of Irish
blood, who sought freedom at home in vain and came here to enjoy
it, it was especially fitting that an Irishman, Senator Smilie of South
Carolina, should introduce the bill for their repeal. He was chairman
of the committee on foreign affairs on the part of the senate.</p>

<p class='c006'>John T. Morse, in his “American Statesmen” series, characterizes
the alien and sedition laws as the “two great blunders of the Federal
party,” and adds: “No one has ever been able heartily or successfully
to defend these foolish outbursts of ill-considered legislation.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Another Irishman, John Daly Burk of <cite>The Time-Piece</cite> published
in New York city was arrested under the alien and sedition
law. This John Daly Burk had a most interesting history. He
published the first daily paper in Boston. Said to be of the same
family as the great Edmund Burke, he was expelled from Trinity
College, Dublin, for patriotic articles contributed to the <cite>Dublin
Evening Post</cite>, a paper which advocated the cause of the people
against the rule of England. The expulsion of young Burk from
Trinity only rekindled his patriotism and he rallied around the
young band of patriots who were getting ready for the uprising of
’98. A brother patriot was being led to the gallows one day. As
the procession passed Trinity’s steps, where Burk, in company with
about thirty young men, was standing, he called out that if there
was an Irishman in the crowd, to follow him for the purpose of rescuing
the prisoner. The attempt proved unsuccessful. Burk
escaped to a house where lived a woman named Daly. She fitted
him out in woman’s garb and in this disguise he escaped from Ireland,
making his way to America, landing in Boston. Being without
means and desiring to show his gratitude to his protectress, Burk
assumed her name, and ever after he signed himself John Daly
Burk.</p>

<p class='c006'>Boston in those days was not a very hospitable town for an Irishman
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>to settle in, but Burk fought against great odds and overcame
what seemed to be insurmountable obstacles. On October 6, 1796,
he issued the <cite>Polar Star and Daily Advertiser</cite>. It was the first daily
paper published in the town. It was printed by Alexander Martin,
at the corner of Water Street and Quaker Lane. Copies of the
paper are extant, and are well worth perusal. It had considerable
display advertising. It started out with a well written address to
the public on the advantages of a daily paper. Speaking of the
policy of the paper, the editor said: “It will have more frequent opportunities
of defending the great principles of American Independence;
encouraging the arts and chastising the enemies of the federal
constitution whatever mask they may wear or whatever denomination
they may assume.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Further along in his address to the people, Burk apologized for
calling the residents of Boston his fellow-citizens, but, he added, he
was their fellow citizen, for the moment a stranger puts his foot on
American soil “his fetters,” to use his own language, “are rent to
pieces.”</p>

<p class='c006'>In concluding his leading editorial, Burk said: “The <cite>Polar Star</cite>,
like a stern and impartial tribune of criticism, shall be open to reasoning
on both sides, but it will hear only reasoning. It will curb
the spirit of faction; silence the clamor of revenge and heal the
wounds of the unfortunate.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Burk complained of the treatment accorded him by the other Boston
papers of the period. In a paragraph, one day, he called attention
to the fact that none deigned to notice the <cite>Polar Star</cite>, and
remarked that if its promoters had not taken the trouble to register
its birth in the temple of freedom, the world would not have been
the wiser.</p>

<p class='c006'>In another issue, he calls attention to the fact that “a gentleman
possessing the wisdom of a Socrates,” declined to subscribe to his
paper, “because the editor was an <i>Irishman</i>.” The italics are
Burk’s.</p>

<p class='c006'>The <cite>Polar Star and Daily Advertiser</cite> gave each political party an
equal showing in its news columns, but its editor early incurred the
enmity of President Adams. Of the presidential canvass preceding
the election of John Adams, who was the candidate of the Federalists,
Editor Burk observed in his paper:</p>

<p class='c006'>“We hope the future president will be as good a Republican as
Washington. Never has the venerable patriot been known to utter
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>a sentiment favorable to royalty. He ought to be a friend to the
revolution of Holland and France; he ought not to be willing to
divide the people by any distinction; Americans should have but
one denomination—the people.”</p>

<p class='c006'>It would seem that President Adams kept a sharp eye on Burk
while in Boston. It was his intention, says Burk’s son in his
memoirs of his father, to hand the Boston editor over to the captain
of a British frigate lying in Boston harbor. Great Britain at that
time was claiming all her subjects, wherever found. Many an
American vessel was searched for escaped Irish patriots, and on this
right of search, the war of 1812 was waged. Had Burk ever been
handed over to the British captain, there is no doubt but that he
would have been hanged at the yard arm of the vessel. As it was,
Burk was obliged to flee from Boston, fearing surrender to the
British, leaving his daily paper on the hands of the printer, who
soon afterwards abandoned it and removed to Philadelphia, then the
seat of the Federal government.</p>

<p class='c006'>It was Aaron Burr who gave Burk the first intimation of President
Adams’ intention to turn him over to the British authorities, and in
more ways than one Hamilton’s inveterate political enemy facilitated
Burk’s escape to New York, where he published <cite>The Time-Piece</cite>.
Thus, Boston lost a brilliant man and her first daily paper was reluctantly
abandoned after six months’ existence.</p>

<p class='c006'>While in Boston, Burk married a widow named Curtis, formerly
Christine Borne. She bore him one son, John Junius Burk, who
became a distinguished jurist of Louisiana. Mrs. Curtis had two
boys by her first marriage. One of them married a sister of President
John Tyler. John Junius Burk left several accomplished
children who were justly proud of John Daly Burk, their grandfather,
the pioneer of Boston daily journalism. After his New York experience
Burk took up his residence among the Republicans of Virginia.
Jefferson, Randolph and other distinguished patriots were
proud to have him in their company. He wrote one of the best
histories of Virginia published, and took an active part in public
matters, being in great demand for public speaking.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the <cite>Richmond Enquirer</cite> of May 27, 1808, were printed proposals
for publishing the ancient and modern music of Ireland, by
John McCreery and Skelton Jones. Burk wrote a fine essay on the
subject for the work. This book, it is said, suggested to Thomas
Moore his Irish melodies. Dr. Robinson, who wrote the preface to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>McCreery’s work, was a classmate of Moore at Trinity College,
Dublin. Burk’s ending was dramatic. He was killed in a duel by
a Frenchman in Virginia in 1808. Although Burk was the publisher
of the first daily paper in Boston, the impartial historians of the
Hub dismiss him by a mere mention of his name when they condescend
to refer to his paper at all, but an honored son has preserved
the important facts of his distinguished and interesting career.</p>

<p class='c006'>A most interesting character in pioneer journalism in America was
Andrew Brown, an Irishman who published the <cite>Federal Gazette</cite> in
Philadelphia. He, too, was a graduate of Trinity college. He
came to America when a young man, settled in Massachusetts, and
fought on the patriots’ side at Lexington, Concord and Bunker Hill.
He took an active part in the campaigns of Generals Gates and
Greene.</p>

<p class='c006'>Brown’s paper was the first to publish reports of the doings of
Congress. He upheld the constitution when it was assailed, and
earned the gratitude of men no less distinguished than Washington.</p>

<p class='c006'>Another of the early Irish-American publishers was John Dunlap
of the <cite>Pennsylvania Packet</cite>, the first daily published in America. He
was born in Strabane, Ireland, in 1747. He died in Philadelphia in
November, 1812. He was the first congressional printer, and acted
as such to the Continental Congress. His paper was first to print
the Declaration of Independence. He was an officer in the First
Philadelphia cavalry which acted as Washington’s body-guard at
Trenton and Princeton. Dunlap was an intense patriot, and during the
Revolutionary War contributed more than £4,000 to the support of
the Revolutionary army. He was a member of that noble band, the
Friendly Sons of St. Patrick, of Philadelphia, which furnished more
field officers to the Revolutionary army and rendered more material
aid to the colonists in the struggle for independence than any other
single society.</p>

<p class='c006'>Another prominent Philadelphia journalist of Irish birth was
Mathew Carey, a native of Dublin. He landed in Philadelphia
November 15, 1784. He had just been released from an English
prison for political offenses. Two months later he issued the <cite>Philadelphia
Herald</cite>. The <cite>Herald</cite> was the first paper to give correct
legislative reports of Congress, Carey acting as his own reporter.
For his vigorous opposition to English tyranny in his native land, he
found himself one day a prisoner behind the bars at Newgate. Previous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>to this he was obliged to flee, for a vigorous use of his able pen
in behalf of Irish freedom. He went to Paris and there made the
acquaintance of the American minister, Benjamin Franklin, who
gave him employment as clerk in the American embassy. After a
year’s absence he returned to Dublin. He and Franklin were life-long
friends, and it was he, I believe, who remarked to Franklin one
day, that he agreed with the great philosopher in everything except
religion.</p>

<p class='c006'>He remained at his post editing his paper during the yellow fever
epidemic in Philadelphia, when all other editors felt obliged to
desert their posts. He wrote and published much on economic and
political subjects. His articles on protection were translated into
different languages, and had a large sale. He fought a duel with
Colonel Oswald, editor of a rival journal, and was confined to his bed
for sixteen months, the result of wounds received from his antagonist.
Mathew Carey was the first publisher of an American history.
It was written by an Irish Presbyterian, Dr. Ramsay.</p>

<p class='c006'>Perhaps the most interesting character among the Philadelphia
editors of Irish blood was William Duane. He was the editor of the
<cite>Aurora</cite>. Born in New York of Irish parents, he was sent to Ireland
to be educated, graduating at Trinity College with honors. In 1794
we find him in India where he started a paper called the <cite>World</cite> and
accumulated quite a fortune. With his inherent love of freedom,
Duane championed the cause of the colonists against the East India
Company. He was invited to breakfast one day with the governor
of the colony, was arrested and sent to London in irons without any
explanation. After petitioning for redress he awaited the outcome.
Meanwhile he was employed editing the <cite>General Advertiser</cite>, which
was subsequently merged into the <cite>London Times</cite>.</p>

<p class='c006'>In 1795 Duane gave up his hope of redress from the Company
and left London in disgust, coming to Philadelphia, where he became
the editor of the <cite>Aurora</cite>, the leading organ of the Democratic party.
It was to him that Jefferson attributed his election, owing to the
vigorous advocacy of his candidacy through the <cite>Aurora</cite> columns
which at that time was regarded as the most influential paper in
America. President Jefferson made him a lieutenant-colonel in
1805, and during the war of 1812 he was adjutant-general of the
army, which afforded the editor of the <cite>Aurora</cite> an opportunity to
retaliate on his old enemy, England. The change of the seat of
government from Philadelphia to Washington, diminished the influence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>of his paper, and later he retired from its editorship. He
traveled much after retirement from his editorial labors, and on his
return from abroad devoted himself to literary pursuits. He published
a great many works on military subjects.</p>

<p class='c006'>His son, who was born in Ireland, was originally a printer and
paper dealer in Philadelphia. He studied law, was admitted to
practice and represented Philadelphia in the state legislature for
many years. He, like his father, took a deep interest in public
matters, especially the building up of the great common school system
of Philadelphia. He was his father’s right hand man in his
editorial labors and secretary of the treasury in 1833 under President
Jackson. He was removed from his position by the president
after a controversy, for his refusal to remove the deposits from the
United States bank during the exciting bank troubles. He was an
author of note and wrote much on political and economic subjects.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Binns family who settled in Philadelphia at the close of the
eighteenth century were natives of Dublin. John and Benjamin
were printers. John was tried in England for “treason,” but
escaped punishment. Soon after his acquittal he was rearrested
on a similar charge and served three years in jail. He came to
America in 1801. In 1802 he commenced the publication of the
<cite>Republican Argus</cite> at Northumberland, Penn., and in 1807 issued the
<cite>Democratic Press</cite> at Philadelphia. For many years it was a most
influential paper. For twenty years John Binn was an alderman of
the city of Philadelphia, and was always active in matters affecting
his native land. He was the first man to print an absolutely correct
copy of the Declaration of Independence. For this public service
he received the thanks of John Quincy Adams and General
Lafayette. Appended to the copy of the document was a fac simile
of the signatures of the signers of the immortal Declaration.</p>

<p class='c006'>The proprietor of the <cite>New Jersey State Gazette</cite> which was established
in 1792, the first daily paper published in that state, was
William B. Kenny, the son of Irish parents. Under President
Fillmore he was American minister to Sardinia.</p>

<p class='c006'>Dr. James Hagan, the fighting editor of the <cite>Vicksburg</cite> (Miss.) <cite>Sentinel</cite>,
was one of the earliest daily newspaper men in the South. He
was killed in the prime of life while on his way to his office one day
in 1842, by the editor of the <cite>Vicksburg Whig</cite>, with whom he had
had a controversy. Dr. Hagan’s associate in the enterprise was
James Ryan.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>In the early life of the nineteenth century we find Henry O’Reilly
editing the <cite>New York Columbian</cite>. At seventeen he was editor of
the <cite>Patriot</cite>, ably advocating, in 1842, the election of DeWitt Clinton,
an Irish immigrant’s son, as governor of the Empire state. In 1826
the <cite>Rochester Daily Advertiser</cite> was issued and was the first daily
between the Hudson river and the Pacific Ocean. O’Reilly was
then only twenty-one years old, but was considered one of the ablest
men in his profession at that time. He was a great advocate of the
canal system of New York and was always ready to defend it from
the attacks of designing politicians. He was one of the foremost
champions of the great common school system of his state. To
him belongs the credit of the establishment of the State Agricultural
college. Almost every state in the Union has followed New York’s
lead in this matter. As a promoter of the infant telegraph business,
Mr. O’Reilly is acknowledged to have been the foremost man in
the matter, assisting Morse with his pen and money. No man had
more influence than O’Reilly throughout the state, and at the
breaking out of the Rebellion he did yeoman service for the Union
cause. He died in 1867, loved and respected by all.</p>

<p class='c006'>William Cassidy, the son of Irish parents, was born in Albany,
N. Y., in 1815. His father was a great friend of DeWitt Clinton,
the governor of New York. Cassidy was the editor of the <cite>Albany
Atlas</cite> and <cite>Argus</cite> which were united in 1856, taking the name of the
<cite>Argus</cite>. From that date the <cite>Albany Argus</cite> has been one of the leading
papers of New York state. Cassidy was a fine classical scholar,
and for many years secretary of the Democratic state committee.
He was a noted platform builder and often helped his party out of
trying positions.</p>

<p class='c006'>James McCarroll was a noted journalist of his day. He was
born in the county Longford, Ireland, came to this country when
a young man, and in 1845 was a proprietor of the <cite>Peterboro Chronicle</cite>.
Later in life he was engaged as a musical and dramatic critic
on New York daily papers. His father fell, fighting bravely for the
Union, at Antietam.</p>

<p class='c006'>Who is there that does not recall Fitz James O’Brien and his
heroism on Union battlefields, that won him the official praise of
two great generals? He lived a newspaper man, a poet, and a
writer of preëminent ability. He died a Union soldier. He gave
his life to his adopted country freely and without price. A record
of heroic deeds on the battlefields survives him. Of him, suffice it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>to say, that during his ten years’ residence in America, this adopted
citizen brought out some of the most brilliant writings of their class
published. He died in Virginia, an aide in the staff of General
Landers, from the effects of a wound received in a charge he led,
and lies buried in Greenwood cemetery, New York, in an honored
grave.</p>

<p class='c006'>The mention of poor O’Brien recalls to mind Charles Dawson
Shanley, another Irishman, who died in 1875. For eighteen years
Mr. Shanley occupied a prominent place in American journalism,
having been connected with several New York newspapers as editor
and contributor. His poems and novels still delight the lover of
realistic beauty. His old friend, William Winter, paid this tribute
to him in the columns of the <cite>New York Tribune</cite>, April 19, 1875:
“There is no one of the busy workers in journalism who will not be
benefited by reflection upon a character so pure and simple, a life so
industrious, useful and blameless, and an end so tranquil.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Col. James Mulligan once edited a Chicago paper. General
Thomas Francis Meagher, of ’48 fame, was editing the <cite>Irish News</cite>
in New York at the breaking out of the Rebellion of ’61.</p>

<p class='c006'>Robert S. McKenzie, a native of Limerick, Ireland, a graduate of
Fermoy, was noted for his literary work, and was engaged in general
newspaper correspondence for many years.</p>

<p class='c006'>One of the most successful journalists of Irish blood was Thomas
Kinsella, editor of the <cite>Brooklyn Eagle</cite>. Mr. Kinsella was born in
Ireland in 1832, learned his trade as a printer and in 1861 was
editing the <cite>Brooklyn Eagle</cite>. He was postmaster at Brooklyn, member
of Congress, one of the original Brooklyn bridge trustees, and at
one time president of the St. Patrick club of Brooklyn.</p>

<p class='c006'>In Indiana, no two newspaper men of their time were better known
than Thomas and John Dowling in the early part of the nineteenth
century.</p>

<p class='c006'>A son of Judge John D. Phelan of Tennessee, who graduated
with high honor at Nashville University, started a Democratic paper
in Huntersville, conducting it with success. Editor Phelan was a
leading figure in politics and at his death was a judge of the supreme
court of Tennessee.</p>

<p class='c006'>Michael Burnham was the name of the man, who, when the century
was young, issued the <cite>New York Post</cite> and <cite>Herald</cite>.</p>

<p class='c006'>Although the founder of the <cite>New York Herald</cite>, James Gordon
Bennett, was of Scotch birth, his mother was an Irishwoman, being
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>the descendant of an old and honorable Dublin family. Mr. Bennett
studied for the priesthood in the old country, but soon abandoned
the idea, came to Boston where he read proof for a while, and
after a varied experience in newspaper life settled in New York
and in 1835 started the <cite>New York Herald</cite>.</p>

<p class='c006'>James Gordon Bennett’s great competitor, Horace Greeley, of the
<cite>New York Tribune</cite>, was a New Hampshire boy, born of Irish parents
in the town of Amherst. No man carried more influence than
Greeley, and in the days of the war and the decade following it the
<cite>Tribune</cite> was a great power in national politics.</p>

<p class='c006'>One of the foremost newspaper men of the South was the late
United States Senator Patrick Walsh of Georgia. He was a native
of Limerick. He came to America with his parents when a child.
He was a hard worker in his youth and earned enough money sticking
type to pay his way at Georgetown college. He was at college
when his adopted state seceded and he went home to join the
Meagher Guard, an Irish company attached to the first regiment of
South Carolina. He had filled every position on the paper, and in
1873 became one of the owners of the <cite>Augusta Chronicle</cite>.</p>

<p class='c006'>Few journalists in America occupy the high position in their profession
that Col. Alexander Kelly McClure, who, with the McLaughlin
brothers, started the <cite>Philadelphia Times</cite>, one of the leading
papers in the country to-day. Mr. McClure comes from the Pennsylvania
Irish which has furnished so many remarkable men in American
history. He has been an important factor in journalism for nearly
half a century now and counts among his nearest friends the leading
men of the nation. He was particularly prominent in the War
of the Rebellion and was on the most intimate terms with
President Lincoln.</p>

<p class='c006'>As a war correspondent Joseph B. McCullagh, late editor of the
<cite>St. Louis Globe-Democrat</cite>, had few equals. He was a native of
Dublin, which he early left, coming to America when a boy. He
had a varied and successful newspaper career. He was in the Wilderness
with Grant and with Sherman on his march to the sea. In
his campaign with Grant a friendship was formed which lasted until
the death of the hero of the Rebellion.</p>

<p class='c006'>One of the leading newspaper men of Pittsburg to-day is Thomas
J. Keenan, the son of an Irish-American soldier distinguished for
his bravery. Mr. Keenan recently gave a $30,000 home to the newsboys
of Pittsburg.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>Thomas Fitzgerald, for many years connected with the New York
<cite>Commercial Advertiser</cite>, and the <cite>Item</cite>, of Philadelphia, which he
founded, was in his day one of the leaders in American journalism.
He died in 1891, after turning his paper over to his son. He was a
noted dramatist, and during the War of the Rebellion was an intense
patriot. He was a noted public speaker. Charles Sumner said of
a speech of his delivered in Boston, that it was one of the best
extemporaneous addresses he had ever listened to.</p>

<p class='c006'>At the head of the <cite>Scranton</cite> (Pa.) <cite>Truth</cite> is James Joseph Jordan,
born of Irish parents, while the Farrells of Albany, N. Y., are also
well-known and influential in the newspaper world.</p>

<p class='c006'>The late Joseph Medill, of Chicago, the son of Irish parents,
made the <cite>Chicago Tribune</cite> a great newspaper. He ranked with
Charles A. Dana of the <cite>N. Y. Sun</cite>.</p>

<p class='c006'>Thomas O’Conor, the father of New York’s greatest jurist, Charles
O’Conor, was among the best known and gifted newspaper men in
the early ’40’s.</p>

<p class='c006'>Theodore O’Hara, the gifted poet of the South, was a newspaper
man of wide experience. Himself a Kentucky soldier, he wrote the
beautiful poem entitled “The Bivouac of the Dead,” when the
remains of the Kentucky soldiers who fell at Buena Vista in the
Mexican War were brought home to their native state. Lines from
his poems are inscribed over the entrances of several of the national
cemeteries. By a resolution of the Kentucky legislature, his remains
were conveyed from Georgia, where he died, to his native state and
they now lie beside those whom he had commemorated in his beautiful
lines, and beside whom he had fought the battles of his country.</p>

<p class='c006'>Daniel Kane O’Donnell as an all round newspaper man and a war
correspondent, had few equals. He represented the <cite>Philadelphia
Press</cite> on Sherman’s march to the sea. After the war he became
connected with the <cite>New York Tribune</cite>, and was made correspondent
of the paper in Mexico, and later in Cuba, his interesting letters attracting
world-wide attention. Subsequently, he returned to the
home office and was given charge of the foreign affairs of the paper.</p>

<p class='c006'>At the head of the war correspondents of the Orient and Europe
stands Januarius Aloysius McGahan, an Irish-American journalist.
His first notable newspaper connection was as the Paris correspondent
of the <cite>New York Herald</cite>. McGahan was about to return from
Europe after a course in international law, when he was retained by
Mr. Bennett as the <cite>Herald</cite> correspondent.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>He overtook the retreating Frenchmen at Bordeaux and accompanied
them to Lyons, sending graphic dispatches to his paper
in the form of interviews with the leaders of all parties. This
surprised the European newspapers, as it was the introduction of
newspaper interviewing in the old world. He was the only correspondent
who remained in Paris during the commune, and kept the
readers of the <cite>Herald</cite> thoroughly informed as to what was going on
in the turbulent French capital. He was arrested by the French
government for intimacy with the rebels, but through the intercession
of the American minister was released.</p>

<p class='c006'>After this he was made correspondent at St. Petersburg by the
<cite>Herald</cite>, and was on the most intimate terms with the czar. He was
at the bombardment of Khiva, and in 1874 reported the Carlist war,
living in the saddle and being frequently under fire. To follow
McGahan would require a whole evening. He continued to be the
most renowned correspondent of his day, and died of fever at his
post of duty during the Bulgarian war in 1875.</p>

<p class='c006'>Another famous <cite>New York Herald</cite> war correspondent was James
O’Kelly, who made a world-wide reputation in his dispatches from
Cuba in the early ’70’s. Born in Ireland, a French soldier in Mexico,
he came to America and engaged in the newspaper business, becoming
an attache of the <cite>New York Herald</cite>. He was condemned to
death for his part in the Cuban insurrection, but was saved that
fate by the state department. After his release he returned to Ireland,
and was elected to parliament on entering politics.</p>

<p class='c006'>It was Daniel O’Neil, a native of Wexford, who started the <cite>Pittsburg
Dispatch</cite>, one of the leading papers of the West to-day. His
brother, Eugene O’Neil, is now the editor.</p>

<p class='c006'>Ex-Mayor Hugh O’Brien, of Boston, scored a signal success as a
journalist.</p>

<p class='c006'>James McConnell, who died recently, was one of the best known
newspaper men of Philadelphia. He learned to set type at the case
adjoining that of the late John Russell Young. Later, he became
proofreader on the <cite>Philadelphia Press</cite>, then owned by John Forney.
He became night editor, and during the Civil War war correspondent
of that paper. When John Russell Young became managing
editor of the <cite>New York Tribune</cite> under Horace Greeley, Mr.
McConnell came to New York and while with the <cite>Tribune</cite> was successively
day editor, Albany correspondent, traveling political correspondent,
night editor and political editor in the office. After
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>serving the <cite>Tribune</cite> he went to Philadelphia and associated himself
with the <cite>Evening Star</cite>, and at the time of his death was managing
editor of the <cite>Star</cite>.</p>

<p class='c006'>Add to this already remarkable list, a Grady in the South, a
Blaine in the North. Nothing that I might say regarding these distinguished
men of Irish origin would add to the already large stock
of knowledge possessed by the public concerning them. Their names
are household words. They lived but as yesterday. Their influence
is still felt.</p>

<p class='c006'>In treating a subject of this character one could hardly forget the
debt of gratitude the Irish people in America owe to Patrick Donahoe,
the venerable founder of the <cite>Boston Pilot</cite>, and his brilliant and
scholarly successor as editor of that paper, the lamented John Boyle
O’Reilly. Coming down to the present time, we would not be doing
justice to ourselves did we not pause in admiration of the present
gifted editor of the <cite>Pilot</cite>, James Jeffrey Roche, and also of Stephen
O’Meara, the manager of the <cite>Boston Journal</cite>. Time permits only a
passing notice of these brilliant lights in American journalism. In
this hasty review of the men of Irish blood who have taken such an
active part in American newspaper work, I doubt not that many
worthy men have escaped notice. It is inevitable in such an undertaking.
Experience teaches that if one were to put the works on
the Irish in America together, something and somebody would be
missing.</p>

<p class='c006'>Enough has been shown to establish the fact that Irishmen by
birth or blood may justly claim a large share of putting the
American newspaper on its feet, so to speak. This is not said in
any boastful vein. The only desire is to show that in the building
up of this great industry Irishmen did their share of the work.
Effort has been made to keep within the bounds of actual facts,
most of them being obtained from unwilling witnesses, men who,
when they are forced to include in their chronicles men of our race,
endeavor oftentimes to make them out “Scotch-Irish.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Men like Burk, Carey, Dunlap, Brown and Duane may have been
“adventurists and refugees.” God grant us more such “adventurists
and refugees,” for they lived useful lives here. They left their
imprint on the land. The historian who would apply the term
“adventurists and refugees” to such men should reflect that, had the
American cause failed, Washington, Adams, Jefferson and many
other patriots would have come within their term of “adventurists
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>and refugees,” and probably would have been seeking liberty elsewhere,
as were these men, far from the land of their nativity.</p>

<p class='c006'>These pioneers in American journalism came here,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Where no caste barrier stays the poor man’s son,</div>

      <div class='line'>Where every hand subscribes to every rule,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And free as air are voice, and vote, and school.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>“They may sleep in their silent tomb,” to quote the words of
Thomas D’Arcy Magee, another brilliant Irish-American journalist,
“but the remembrance of their virtue will be cherished while liberty
is dear to the American heart.”</p>

<p class='c006'>A distinguished man, Gen. Patrick A. Collins, once observed that
of all the brilliant Irishmen he ever knew—and he has known
many—John Boyle O’Reilly and D’Arcy Magee could do more things
and do them better than any of their contemporaries.</p>

<p class='c005'>The number of distinctive Irish names met in looking over the
early records of North Carolina, Virginia, South Carolina, and Kentucky
is simply wonderful. When are added to them the names
more distinctively Scotch, but fully as Gaelic in origin as the Irish,
one is justified in believing what Ramsay wrote in 1789, that:</p>

<p class='c006'>“The colonies which now form the United States may be considered
as Europe transplanted. Ireland, England, Scotland, France,
Germany, Holland, Switzerland, Sweden, Poland, and Italy furnished
the original stock of the present population and have been supposed
to contribute to it in the order enumerated. For the last seventy or
eighty years no nation has contributed so much to the population of
America as Ireland.”<a id='r23' /><a href='#f23' class='c016'><sup>[23]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Dr. Hart and William Coomes were the first Catholic settlers in
Kentucky, locating in Harrodsburgh in 1775. The doctor was the
first medical practitioner in the state, as Mrs. Coomes was the first
teacher. This credit is given them in Collins’ History of Kentucky.
Among the fortified stations or forts built for protection from
the Indians by the early settlers, not a few bore names familiar to
Irish ears, denoting the presence of many of the old race.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>Among them may be mentioned Bryan’s Station, Dougherty’s Station,
Drennan’s Lick, Feagan’s Station, Finn’s Station, Fleming’s
Station, Hart’s Station, Higgins’ Block House, Irish Station, Lynch’s
Station, Logan’s Fort, McAfee’s Station, McFadden’s Station,
McGee’s Station, Sullivan’s Old Station, Sullivan’s New Station,
Sullivan’s Station, Daniel Sullivan’s Station, McGuire’s Station,
McCormack’s Station, McKeenan’s Station, McConnell’s Station,
Kennedy’s Station, Givin’s Station, McKinley’s Station, McMillan’s
Station, Owen’s Station, Kilgore Station, Hoy Station, Kinchelloe’s
Station and Gilmore’s Station.</p>

<p class='c006'>Ten Kentucky counties bear Irish names: Adair, Butler, Logan,
Hart, Montgomery, McCracken, Boyle, Carroll, Rowan, and Casey.
John Carty, the most successful merchant in Lexington, was the son
of John Carty, a native of Ireland who went early to Kentucky
from New Jersey; and General James Morrison, for many years one
of the leading men of the state, was the son of another Irish
emigrant.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>The following served in the several companies named, during the
Revolution, on detached service, mainly against the Indians, who
were the auxiliaries of the British:</p>

<p class='c006'>In Captain Bourman’s company,—William Barry, Edward Bulger,
Patrick Doran, Isaac McBride, Robert McClanahan, Edward Murray,
Joseph Michael and Thomas Pendergast.</p>

<p class='c006'>Captain Logan’s company,—Capt. Benj. Logan, Lieut. John
Logan, William Casey, George Flynn, Bartholomew Fenton, Stephen
Houston, John McCormack, John McElhone, James McElwain,
John McKaine, Archibald Mahone, William Neal.</p>

<p class='c006'>Captain Harrod’s company,—Daniel Driskill, John Conway, Patrick

<p class='c006'>Captain Boyle’s company,—Capt. John Boyle, Barney Boyle,
Elisha Clary, James Coyle, Owen Devine, Peter Higgins, Robert

<p class='c006'>Captain Holder’s company,—James Barry, James Bryan, John
Butler, William Collins, William McGee, Hugh Ross.</p>

<p class='c006'>Captain Boone’s company,—John Butler, Patrick Ryan, Morgan
Hughes, John McFadden.</p>

<p class='c006'>An idea can be formed of the Irish blood in Kentucky during
those stirring times, from the character of the names given. Nearly
all the great Gaelic family names are represented, and the absence
of Scriptural (Old Testament) names, so common among those of
the Presbyterian and Congregational denominations, indicates that
these men were of Catholic stock when they, or their fathers, immigrated.
The first settlers of the “Blue Grass” state were from
Virginia, North Carolina and Pennsylvania,—nearly all of this stock,
which no doubt accounts for the gallantry and beauty of the modern
Kentuckians, men and women, and the superior quality of the whiskey
and horses, for the usquebaugh, or “mountain dew,” was first
distilled in Ireland, and when first tasted by the sluggish Saxons,
the effect was such on their thick blood, muddied by beer, that they
considered it good not only as a beverage, but as “cure-all” for
medicinal purposes.</p>

<p class='c006'>James McBride, an Irishman, has the credit of being the first
white man to enter the territory, “paddling his canoe up the Kentucky
river in 1745.” Twenty years later Col. George Croghan, the
well-known Indian agent of the same stock, was at Shawane town,
on the Ohio river.</p>

<p class='c006'>When Daniel Boone left North Carolina for Kentucky in 1769, he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>was accompanied by James Mooney, John Stewart, Joseph Holden,
John Findlay and William Cool, all but the leader being of Irish
stock.</p>

<p class='c006'>In 1775, James, George and Robert McAfee, and James McCowen
went to the territory on a surveying tour. In 1778 Capt. James
Grattan, John Tuel and John McManus were among those who laid
the permanent foundation of the city of Louisville. Bryan’s station
was one of the earliest garrisons for protection against the Indians,
and two of the prominent Indian fighters were Captains Orr and
Shannon.</p>

<p class='c006'>Captain Flynn was one of the founders of the town of Columbia,
1787, and Dr. John Connelly was agent in 1778 for the British government
in the territory. The first newspaper established northwest
of the Ohio, in Cincinnati, was by William Maxwell, of the same stock.</p>

<p class='c006'>Col. John Lutteral, an Irishman, was one of a party which left
North Carolina for Boonesboro’, Ky., in April, 1775. He was one
of the pioneers and a noted man for years. He was accompanied
by John Hart and John Kennedy. Daniel Boone was the leader.
Captain Flynn, who has been mentioned as one of the founders of
Columbia, had as associates Francis Dunleavy and John Riley.</p>

<p class='c006'>Among the first settlers of Harrodsburgh were the families of
McGarry and Hogan, welcome acquisitions on account of their
wives and children. Major McGarry was one of the bravest, as
well as one of the best known, Indian fighters in Kentucky, having
for an associate a brother Celt named Major McBride, and another
named Captain Bulger. The recital of their deeds would alone fill
a good-sized volume.</p>

<p class='c006'>In an attack on Bryan’s station, a garrison named after another
Celt, by a party of 500 Indians, in 1782, the savages were repulsed,
but some of the women were killed. This enraged the whites in the
vicinity, and a party of 160 met at the station to arrange for the pursuit
and punishment of the Indians. The cooler heads, led by Daniel
Boone, tried to dissuade the hotheads from making the attempt,
but in the midst of the discussion the impetuous McGarry, putting
spurs to his horse, cried out for all but the cowards to follow him,
and galloped in the direction taken by the savage foe. Every man
of the 160, nettled by the taunt, followed him, but the result which
was predicted, followed. They fell into an ambuscade and sixty of
the number were killed, among them McBride and Bulger. McGarry
fought like a madman and escaped unhurt.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>Among the first Presbyterian ministers in the state were James
McCready, William McGill, Samuel McAdoo, Henry Delaney, A.
M. Bryan, William McGee, William McMahon and John Dunleavy;
and among the first Methodist ministers were James O’Cull, William
Burke, William McMahon and John and William McGee, all Irish
enough in appearance to be staunch Catholics of the old Milesian
type, and it is not unlikely their fathers may have been.</p>

<p class='c006'>Among those who distinguished themselves in the history of the
state as legislators, soldiers or writers, were Wm. T. Barry, who was
chief justice of the court of appeals in 1825; one of a commission to
digest a plan of schools for common education; lieutenant-governor
in 1820; member of the National House of Representatives in
1810‒’11; and in the United States Senate in 1814‒’16.</p>

<p class='c006'>Gen. John Adair held high command in the War of 1812‒’15;
received the thanks of the Kentucky legislature for gallantry at New
Orleans; was governor of Kentucky in 1820; in the National
House of Representatives 1814‒’16, and had served in the United
States Senate in 1805‒’06. John Rowan was secretary of state in
1804; Benjamin Logan was presidential elector in 1793, William
Logan in 1809, and Robert Ewing, William Irvine, William Casey
and William Logan in 1813.</p>

<p class='c006'>The indomitable Matthew Lyon who went from Vermont to Kentucky
was again sent from Kentucky to congress in 1829‒’33‒’35,
and his son, Chittenden Lyon, was there in 1827‒’35. Colonel Chittenden
Lyon was a veritable giant in size, being considerably over six
feet in height and weighing over 350 pounds. The admixture of
Irish and Yankee blood in his make-up, if anything, increased the
pugnacious spirit inherited from his father, who had married one of
the Vermont Chittendens; and the stories told of his prowess as a
wrestler and a boxer are countless.</p>

<p class='c006'>Being at one time a candidate for a public office, when the margin
was close, he was approached by a political opponent, his rival in
fisticuffs as well as in politics, and fully his equal in size and weight,
and challenged to a boxing match, the condition being that the loser
would vote for the winner. This Lyon agreed to, and they went at
it, over 700 pounds of bone and muscle. After a severe contest the
spectators interfered and it was declared a draw, Lyon, however,
receiving his rival’s vote.</p>

<p class='c006'>Thomas Dougherty was clerk of the House of Representatives in
1815. Among native Kentuckians who served in Congress from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>other states were James B. Foley from Indiana, 1857‒’59; Willis A.
Gorman from the same state, 1849‒’53, and also a major-general in
the Civil War; Edward A. Hannegan from the same state, in 1855‒’57;
and Cornelius L. L. Leary from Maryland.</p>

<p class='c006'>Among the noted military men of the Irish stock were Generals
John Boyle, Adair, Croghan and Commander Prendergast.</p>

<p class='c006'>Among Kentucky poets were Dr. John M. Harney, brother to Gen.
W. S. Harney, Theodore O’Hara, Gen. W. O. Butler, W. D. Gallagher,
Noble Butler and William M. Harney. Among legislators and educators,
in addition to those already named, were McNamara, Hogan,
Kane O’Hara, “the great educator” and father of Colonel Theodore,
the poet; Judge James O’Hara, brother to Kane, and Major
James O’Hara, son of the Judge. John McGill, James McGinty,
Cassidy, O’Bamon, Kennan and Finley were also honored names in
the “dark and bloody ground.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Michael Cassidy, born in Ireland and a soldier of the Revolution,
went to Kentucky in 1782. He was small in stature, being barely
five feet in height, but he made up in courage what he lacked in size,
and was, in addition, as tough and wiry as a hickory sapling. He
was considered one of the most noted Indian fighters in his day,
and many anecdotes have been printed about him.</p>

<p class='c006'>Dr. John M. Harney, mentioned elsewhere, went to Kentucky
from Delaware. He was born in 1789. He was the son of Major
Thomas Harney. Major Benjamin F. Harney was an elder brother.
In 1847 he was the senior surgeon in the United States army. A
younger brother was Major-General W. S. Harney, who distinguished
himself in the Florida and Mexican War. He was prominent for
a while at the outbreak of the Civil War, being in command at St.
Louis until relieved by General Fremont.</p>

<p class='c006'>Dr. John M. Harney married the daughter of another Celt, the
celebrated John Rowan, in his day one of the best known and
respected men in Kentucky. In his latter years Dr. Harney
returned to the faith of his fathers, dying in the Catholic fold at
Bardstown, the original seat of Catholicity in Kentucky, on January
15, 1825. Gen. John Adair, for whom the county of that name was
called, was born in South Carolina in 1757. He served in the
Revolutionary War. He was one of Kentucky’s pioneers and first
citizens. His name denotes his origin.</p>

<p class='c006'>Daniel Boone, it is said, was a descendant of one of the original
Catholic settlers of Maryland. Let that be as it may, some of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>name are still found in Maryland, who cling to the old faith. His
is the greatest name among the early pioneers of the state. Boyle
county was named for the Hon. John Boyle, for many years chief
justice of Kentucky, who was a native of Virginia. Butler county
received its name from Major-General Richard Butler of Pennsylvania,
who fought through the Revolutionary War and was killed in
St. Clair’s disastrous defeat, November 4, 1791.</p>

<p class='c006'>Few of the prominent families, not only of Kentucky but of any
state in the Union, have been so distinguished in many ways as this
of General Butler. The emigrant ancestor was Thomas Butler, born
in Kilkenny, Ireland, April 8, 1720. Five of his sons attained eminence
in America. Of these, Richard, William and Thomas were,
like their father, natives of Ireland. Percival and Edward were
born in Pennsylvania. All were officers in the Revolutionary War.
Edward was too young at first, but entered it before its close.
Richard was the second in command of Morgan’s rifle regiment.
He was afterwards its colonel and commanded Wayne’s left in the
attack on Stony Point. All these brothers and their immediate
descendants were engaged in the military service of their country, in
all the wars before 1800; while their survivors were in the war of
1812, and not less than nine of a younger generation were in the
Mexican War.</p>

<p class='c006'>Gen. Percival Butler migrated to Kentucky in 1784. His son,
Col. Thomas L. Butler, was aide to General Jackson in the battle of
New Orleans. A second son, Gen. Wm. O. Butler, also served in
the war of 1812, received the commendations of General Jackson
for bravery at New Orleans, was afterwards appointed on Jackson’s
staff and was a major-general in the Mexican War. The third son,
Richard P. Butler, was assistant adjutant-general in the campaign
of 1812.</p>

<p class='c006'>Campbell county takes its name from Col. John Campbell, a native
of Ireland. He received a grant of four thousand acres of land,
located near Louisville, and during life was one of Kentucky’s noted
men. Carroll county takes its name from Charles Carroll, of
Carrollton.</p>

<p class='c006'>Casey county derives its name from Col. Thomas Casey, who went
from Virginia to Kentucky in 1779. Daviess county was named in
honor of Joseph H. Daviess, who fell at Tippecanoe. He was born
in Virginia, of an Irish father and a Scotch mother. “The warm
heart, free and off-hand, and ready sentiment told in language
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>plainer than words, that the blood of Erin flowed fresh in his
veins.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Fleming county was named for Col. John Fleming, who was born
in Virginia. Fulton county was named for Robert Fulton. Hart
county derived its name from Capt. N. G. T. Hart. His father, Col.
Thomas Hart, was from Maryland. Kenton county takes its name
from the celebrated Simon Kenton. “His father was an Irishman,
his mother of Scotch descent.” He was born in Virginia. His
name is familiar to every reader of the early history of Kentucky.</p>

<p class='c006'>Knox county was named for Gen. Henry Knox of the Revolution.
He was born in Boston of Irish parents, and was a member of “The
Irish Society” of that city. Logan county derives its name from
Gen. Benjamin Logan. His parents came from Ireland. He was
born in Pennsylvania. His is one of Kentucky’s great names. It
is claimed that his son, William Logan, was the first white child born
in Kentucky. McCracken county was named for Capt. Virgil
McCracken, who was killed in the war of 1812. Meade county was
named for Capt. James Meade, who was killed in the same engagement
with Captain McCracken. Montgomery county derives its
name from Gen. Richard Montgomery, who was killed at Quebec.
Wayne county was named in honor of Gen. Anthony Wayne, who
was born in Pennsylvania. His name appears on the roll of members
of the “Friendly Sons of St. Patrick” of Philadelphia.</p>

<p class='c006'>Another noted Kentucky family was that of the O’Haras. Kane
O’Hara went to Kentucky in the latter part of the eighteenth century,
and became in time one of its most distinguished educators.
He was accompanied to this country by his father and two younger
brothers. Of the two latter, Charles went to Georgia, where he followed
the same profession; James remained in Kentucky teaching
for some years, but later was admitted to the bar, and acquired
the reputation of a profound lawyer and able advocate.</p>

<p class='c006'>He was the father of Judge James O’Hara, Jr. Among the large
number of pupils of Kane O’Hara who became famous after,
were several of the Marshalls and Browns,—Major Croghan of the
United States army, and President Zachary Taylor. When on his
way to Washington to be inaugurated, General Taylor departed
from his line of travel in order to visit his old teacher in Frankfort.
“It was an affecting scene when the great soldier, then an old man,
bowed himself in grateful homage before the venerable preceptor of
his youth, and in few but earnest words, thanked him for the care
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>bestowed on his early education, to which he attributed all the achievements
of his after life.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Col. Theodore O’Hara, poet, journalist, and soldier, was the son
of Kane O’Hara. He was educated by his father with the greatest
care, but received his collegiate finish, and graduated, at St. Joseph’s
College, Bardstown, with the first honors of his class. His “Bivouac
of the Dead” has made his name immortal:</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>A great and magnanimous government has had these verses, the
composition of an ex-Confederate soldier, cast separately in bronze
and set up in appropriate places in all the National cemeteries.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is worthy of mention that a lady bearing a now historic name,
at least in song, Mrs. Ann McGinty, brought the first spinning-wheel
into Kentucky, and made the first linen in the territory. She is also
credited with making the first butter there, and with bringing within
its borders the first chickens, ducks and hogs. The first Catholic
priest in Kentucky was Father Whalen, who was in Bardstown in
1787. There were then fifty Catholic families in the state. The
first families to settle there were those of Daniel Boone, Hugh
McGary, Thomas Denton and Richard Hogan. As has been mentioned,
the first practising physician was Dr. Hart, and the first school
teacher was Mrs. Coomes, both Catholics from Maryland.</p>

<p class='c006'>Col. Matthew Lyon, mentioned elsewhere, is alluded to as the most
remarkable character among the public men of southwestern Kentucky.
He was born in Wicklow county, Ireland, in 1746. His
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>father, for being engaged in conspiracy against the English government,
was tried, condemned and executed. To secure his passage,
Matthew bound himself to a sea captain to work for twelve months
after his arrival in America. The captain sold him to a Connecticut
farmer for two bulls; he served his time faithfully and became a free
man. His favorite by-word was forever after “By the bulls that
bought me.” It is worthy of record that Rudyard Kipling has put
these words in the mouth of one of his recently created characters,
without, however, giving Matthew proper credit. It is very evident
that Colonel Lyon never forgot his father’s execution, for he was, up to
the day of his death, an inveterate hater of the English government.</p>

<p class='c006'>After he gained his freedom, he made his home in Vermont. He
founded the town of Fairhaven in 1783, where he built saw and
grist-mills, an iron foundry, engaged in paper making from basswood,
and a variety of other occupations. He served in the Vermont
legislature ten years, and for some time was assistant judge. He
served in congress from his adopted state. He was one of the first
arrested under the alien and sedition laws, was convicted of a libel
on the president, John Adams, fined one thousand dollars, and served
a jail sentence in addition.</p>

<p class='c006'>While in congress, on the thirty-sixth ballot he decided the protracted
seven days’ voting for president by casting his vote and that
of Vermont for Thomas Jefferson, making him president in preference
to Aaron Burr. Shortly after the beginning of the present
century he went to Kentucky with his family. He served in the
legislature of his newly adopted state, and from it, between 1803 and
1811, was in congress eight years.</p>

<p class='c006'>Eighteen years after his death congress voted to refund with
interest the amount of the fine inflicted on him in 1798. This was
done on July 4, 1840. He had a son of the same name who was the
father of Gen. H. B. Lyon. Col. Chittenden Lyon, Matthew’s oldest
son, represented his state in congress eight years, and was fully as
impetuous and honest as his father. Of Matthew Lyon, Gov. John
Reynolds, of Illinois, said, “His Irish impulses were honest, and
always on the side of human freedom. His leading trait of character
was his zeal and enthusiasm, almost a madness itself in any
cause he espoused.” This covered his zeal.</p>

<p class='c006'>The opinion of the members of the first Continental congress, of
the Irish in Ireland, and in the colonies, is well expressed in an
address issued by that body in 1774. In part it said: “Your
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>parliament had done us no wrong; you had ever been friendly to the
rights of mankind, and we acknowledge with pleasure and gratitude
that your nation has produced patriots who have nobly distinguished
themselves in the cause of humanity and America. Accept our
most grateful acknowledgments for the friendly disposition you have
always shown towards us.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The record made by the men whose names appear in this paper,
is evidence that they were worthy of the tribute paid in this address.
What the feeling was in Ireland, a little more than a year later, was
well described by Gen. Ethan Allen, who said that the people of
Cork when they found he was in the harbor, a prisoner on one of
his majesty’s vessels, sent him a plentiful supply of money, food, and
clothing; that it aroused the ire of Captain Simonds, his keeper, who
put an end to the contributions, saying that “the damned rebels of
America should not be feasted by the damned rebels of Ireland.”</p>

</div>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div><span class='small'>BY JAMES L. O’NEILL, ELIZABETH, N. J.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>The territory now occupied by Elizabeth, N. J., was formerly the
abode of savage tribes unknown to fame; whence they came and
how long they had dwelt on these shores are questions that neither
authentic history nor plausible tradition pretends to answer. They
have since passed away without memorial.</p>

<p class='c006'>It was on Sunday, the 6th day of September, 1609, that the eye
of the stranger from the old world first saw this site. Three days
before, a two-masted schooner called the <i>Half Moon</i>, under the command
of the renowned Henry Hudson, cast anchor in Sandy Hook
bay. The adventurous craft was manned by twenty men, Dutch
and English, in the service of the East India Company. Their
design was to explore a passage to China and the Indies by the
northwest.</p>

<p class='c006'>On Sunday, the 6th, John Coleman and four other men were sent
out in a boat to explore the harbor, sailing through the narrows that
they found. The narrow river through which they sailed was the
Kills between Bergen Point and Staten Island and the open sea was
Newark bay. The site of the town that bordered on the bay was,
of course, in full view. These five men are believed to have been
the first European discoverers of this particular spot. Coleman was
slain the same day, on his return, by the treacherous arrow of one
of the natives. It is not at all unlikely that Coleman was an Irishman,
as his name bears the Celtic tone, and as there is nothing to
verify it to the contrary.</p>

<p class='c006'>The most distinguished man of Irish descent who identified himself
completely with this old city was the Rev. James Caldwell, the
eighth pastor of the First Presbyterian church. The Rev. Mr.
Caldwell was a Virginian. His father, John Caldwell, came to this
country with four sisters and his wife and several children, from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>County Antrim, Ireland—what year is unknown to the writer. He
settled first at Chestnut Level, Lancaster county, Pennsylvania.</p>

<p class='c006'>Soon after, he removed to the new settlements in the southern
part of Virginia and located on Cub creek, a branch of the Staunton
river, in what is now known as Charlotte county. Here in the
wilderness, James, the subject of this sketch, the youngest of seven
children, was born in April, 1734. The place was generally known
as the Caldwell Settlement or Cub Creek. A daughter of one of
his brothers, also born here, was the mother of the Hon. John Caldwell
Calhoun of South Carolina, the well-known senator and leading
statesman of the South.</p>

<p class='c006'>James was prepared for college under Rev. John Todd Caldwell
and entered the College of New Jersey. He came hither when the
college was at Newark and formed the acquaintance, while there, of
a young maiden to whom he was afterwards married. He graduated
in September, 1759, and on Sept. 17, 1760, he was ordained. He
received a call from the Presbyterian church of this town in November,
1761, which he accepted. He was duly installed in March,
1762, with an annual salary of £160. He was at that time in the
twenty-seventh year of his age, a young man of prepossessing
appearance and of more than ordinary promise as a preacher of the
gospel. In the year of 1775 charges were preferred to the Presbytery
by former members of the congregation affecting the orthodoxy
of their pastor, Mr. Caldwell, which, however, were found to be of
trivial import and not affecting at all his soundness in the faith.
Whatever uneasiness may have grown out of this matter, it was
speedily forgotten in the rush of events that preceded and precipitated
the War of the Revolution.</p>

<p class='c006'>On the question then at issue Mr. Caldwell’s position was a matter
of public knowledge. He waited not to learn how the struggle
was likely to terminate; his ardent temperament was for his country,
for liberty, for independence. In all his prayers, often in his sermons
and exhortations, and in all his pastoral intercourse, no religious
society in the land took a bolder move or stand, and few were
more efficient for their country’s cause than Reverend Caldwell and his
congregation. And not a little of this patriotism was owing to the fervent
zeal of their pastor. Among his congregation at the commencement
of the Revolution were such men as William Livingston,
governor of the state; Elias Boudinot, afterwards president of the
Continental Congress; Abraham Clark, one of the signers of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>Declaration of Independence; Hon. Robert Ogden, speaker of the
assembly at an earlier day, with his three sons, Robert, Matthias
and Aaron (the two last distinguished officers in the United States
army); Hon. Stephen Crane, speaker of the assembly; Elias Dayton
and his son Jonathan, both of them subsequently general officers
of the army and the latter, speaker of congress. From this one congregation
went forth about forty commissioned officers and privates
to fight the battles for independence.</p>

<p class='c006'>Among the men belonging to the militia of Elizabeth who enlisted
on board of the different sloops as volunteers, in order to take the
ship <i>Blue Mountain Valley</i>, January 22, 1776, under the command of
Colonel Dayton, are to be found the following good old Irish names:
Sergeant Thomas Quigley, Thomas McCarty, Timothy B. Stout,
James Clancey, Timothy Burns, Moses Connell and William
Higgins.</p>

<p class='c006'>Among the commissioned officers of Reverend Caldwell’s congregation
in the army are found a Capt. David Lyons, and Capt. Matthias
Lyons, Irish or of Irish descent, without a doubt.</p>

<p class='c006'>In April, 1776, Colonel Dayton’s regiment, that had been quartered
in the town during the preceding winter, received orders to march
to the relief of the Northern army then besieging Quebec. As most
of the officers and many of the privates were members of Reverend
Caldwell’s congregation, an ardent desire was expressed for his services
as their chaplain.</p>

<p class='c006'>Lieutenant Elmer in his diary, April 28, says: “Members of the
Presbyterian meeting set about Reverend Caldwell’s going to Quebec
with us, which was agreed upon after some debate. Drank tea
at Colonel Dayton’s, then went to Major Spencer’s to lodge.” So it
was determined that Reverend Caldwell, whose consent was readily
obtained, should accompany his townsmen on their Northern expedition.</p>

<p class='c006'>The troops left the town the following day, but Colonel Dayton
and Reverend Caldwell did not join them until Saturday, May 11,
at Albany, N. Y. The Jersey Brigade to which the regiment was
attached was stationed the most of the season in the Mohawk valley.
On the 16th of June Reverend Caldwell was at Johnstown and
at German Flats in July, preaching twice every Sunday and taking
an active part in military operations.</p>

<p class='c006'>In July, as already related, the British troops had taken possession
of Staten Island. The people of the town became greatly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>alarmed for their personal safety, and their relatives in the Northern
army became exceedingly anxious for their friends at home.</p>

<p class='c006'>Reverend Caldwell returned to his family and people early in the
autumn, where his services were pressingly needed. On the retreat
of the American, and the advance of the British, army the last week
of November, 1776, Reverend Caldwell took his family up into the
mountains and found a home for them in the town of New Providence.
From this time forward Reverend Caldwell was occupied
more or less continually in the service of his country to the close of
his life.</p>

<p class='c006'>The enemy having vacated the town at the end of the first
week in January, he returned to his charge and resumed his ministrations,
mingling the duties of the pastor and the soldier together.
At various times through the long years of the war, during which
his congregation were greatly scattered and their means of subsistence
for the most part considerably diminished, Reverend Caldwell
served not only as chaplain of the Jersey Brigade but as assistant
commissary-general from the first of April, 1777, to April, 1779.
Instead of a regular salary, he received for his pastoral service only
what was contributed by the congregation on Sunday.</p>

<p class='c006'>His church was burned down on the night of Tuesday, January
25, 1780, and the services of the congregation were thenceforth held
in Colonel Hatfield’s red storehouse. It is probably while preaching
here, or it may have been at an earlier date, that Reverend Caldwell
(as related by Reverend McDowell) preached with his pistols
lying on each side of him in the pulpit, and the sentinels had to
keep watch during time of service.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Sunday found him, whether at home or in camp, ready to
proclaim the gospel with its message of mercy and comfort to his
fellow men, while he was ever watchful at other times to improve
every opportunity to promote the spiritual welfare of citizens and
soldiers. He was held, therefore, in the highest esteem by officers
and men, confided in by all, and regarded with enthusiastic
love by the rank and file. No one, consequently, save his parishioner,
Governor Livingston, was more feared and hated by the
Tories and the British. Gladly would they have kidnapped him
if they could.</p>

<p class='c006'>At the fall ejection of 1780 he was chosen by his fellow-citizens
a member of the State Council. He continued in the discharge
of his various duties to which he was called until the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>autumn of 1781. The last record made of him by the Presbytery
was at their meeting, May 7, 1782. It is in these words: “The
Rev. James Caldwell departed this life, falling by the hands of a
cruel murderer on the twenty-fourth day of Nov., 1781.” The circumstances
attending this mournful event were very fully announced
in the public prints at the time. Rivington of New York, in his
<cite>Gazette</cite> (a Tory journal of that time), said: “The Rev. Caldwell
was shot dead without any provocation at the Point (now Elizabethport)
by a native of Ireland named Morgan.” Note the sting this
allegation placed to an Irish name.</p>

<p class='c006'>The <cite>New Jersey Journal</cite> and the <cite>New Jersey Gazette</cite> devoted
much space to the murder at the time, but they never mentioned
the murderer’s name nor claimed him to have been Irish. These
are the only accounts written and published at the time. As that of
the <cite>New Jersey Gazette</cite> is the most particular and was written after
sufficient time had been allowed to obtain by means of the coroner’s
inquest, and from other sources, the exact state of the case, it is
apparently the most to be relied upon. It was generally affirmed at
the time that the murderer, as intimated in the <cite>New Jersey Journal</cite>,
was bribed by the British enemy to do the dreadful deed. And it
is not strange that it should have been believed, as it was known
that the British had offered a reward for the apprehension or assassination
of Governor Livingston, and as no other reason could be
assigned for the murder.</p>

<p class='c006'>The body of Rev. Mr. Caldwell was carried to the public house at
the Point, now Red Jacket Hotel. A homely ambulance was
obtained and the body was slowly brought to town. A crowd of
people, greatly excited, gathered by the way. The mournful cortege,
tradition says, passed through Water street, now Elizabeth avenue,
to Broad street; then to Jersey street; and then to the residence of
Mrs. Noll. The day following, when the people gathered for public
worship, the place where they met might well have been named
“Bochim, the Weeping Place.” The people were crushed under
the sad calamity.</p>

<p class='c006'>The funeral service was held on Tuesday, the 27th, the whole
town suspending all business and gathering in uncontrollable grief
at the house of Mrs. Noll. An opportunity was given to the people
to view the corpse in front of the house in the open street. After
all had taken their last look and before the coffin was closed, Dr.
Boudinot came forward leading nine orphan children, and placing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>them around the bier of the parent, made an address of surpassing
pathos to the multitude in their behalf. It was an hour of deep sorrow.
The procession then slowly moved to the grave and laid his
body by his wife’s remains. Over his body was placed a marble
slab with the following inscription:</p>

<p class='c006'>“Sacred to the memory of Rev. James Caldwell and Hannah, his
wife, who fell victims to their country’s cause in the year 1781. He
was a zealous and faithful pastor of the Presbyterian church in this
town, where, by his evangelical labors in the gospel vineyard and
his early attachment to the civil liberty of his country, he has left
in the hearts of his people a better monument than brass or marble.
Here also lies the remains of a woman who exhibited to the world a
bright constellation of female virtues. On that memorable day
never to be forgotten, when a British foe invaded this fair village
and fired even the Temple of the Deity, this peaceful daughter of
heaven retired to her hallowed apartment, imploring heaven for the
pardon of the enemy,—in that sacred moment she was by the
bloody hand of a British ruffian despatched, like her divine Redeemer,
through a path of blood to her long wished for native skies.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The time has come when the history of the Irish people in
America should be written. It will be a grand heritage for the
Irish-Americans. It will show how many of their race fought and
bled for liberty. This history will be a priceless gift for future generations.
It will be a lasting memorial of the noble and patriotic
work of the element.</p>

<p class='c006'>It will show how nobly the men of Irish birth and lineage have
illustrated old Ireland under the benign influences of free institutions
and popular government, where liberty is regulated by law,
where justice balances the scales between man and man without
regard to race or creed, giving to every citizen equal advantages and
equal opportunities in the race of life.</p>

<p class='c006'>A people who have done so much for the honor and glory of this
great republic should feel a just pride in publishing to the world the
part they have taken in the progress of the United States. While
there should be, in the ordinary affairs of life and of government,
no discrimination on account of race or creed, as between citizens
of our common country, each nationality that has borne a prominent
part in its history should seek to perpetuate the record of its people.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the war between the states Americans of Irish birth or descent
stood for the right as they saw it, and fought for their principles and
their convictions with a patriotic fortitude and heroic valor never
surpassed in ancient or modern times. From the shot at Sumter
that was heard around the world until the Confederate banner was
furled forever in imperishable glory at Appomattox, the Irish and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>the Irish-Americans of the North and of the South participated in
and confronted each other in battle array. They fought in the
mightiest contest of all the ages, for their principles and for their
altars and their firesides.</p>

<p class='c006'>I cannot undertake to give in detail the history of the Irish and
the Irish-Americans in South Carolina. It would fill a volume. The
Irish immigration into South Carolina began long since. Of South
Carolina history, they embrace a large part. I find the following in
a reprint of the <cite>Maryland Journal</cite> of August 20, 1773, for which I
am indebted to Gen. Felix Agnus, proprietor of the <cite>Baltimore American</cite>,
which is the successor of the former:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Since our last, arrived here the ship Alexander, Captain Hunter,
with five hundred passengers, and the ship Hannah, Captain
Mitchel, with five hundred and fifty, both from Londonderry.</p>

<p class='c012'>“The ship Walworth, Captain McCausland, sailed from Londonderry
for South Carolina, about the first of June, with three hundred
passengers and servants, who were obliged to leave their native
country, not for their misbehavior, but on account of the great distress
among the middle and lower class of people.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Hon. M. P. O’Connor, upon assuming the presidency of the
Hibernian Society of Charleston many years ago, delivered an
address in which he stated that the Hibernian Society of Charleston,
S. C., was organized in 1799. “Its first president was the
serene and scholarly Rev. Father Gallagher, who was worthily followed
by O’Brien Smith, Simon Magwood, Samuel Patterson,
William A. Caldwell, Thomas Stephens, Henry W. Conner, the
father of Gen. James Conner; James E. Robinson, William Gilliland,
Judge Burke, Governor A. G. Magrath, Bernard O’Neill and M. P.
O’Connor. These men give dignity and character and purpose to
the organization.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Its founders were Thomas A. Malcolm, Edward Courtenay, William
and James Hunter, Joseph Crombie, John S. Adams and a few
others. They professed as the primary object of their union, aid
and relief to the distressed emigrant. But there was latent in their
bosoms an object beyond and higher. It was to preserve the traditions
of their downtrodden race; to embody and cluster around a
common centre, in a genial and hospitable clime, the virtues of their
ancestors, and to reflect in all their splendor under the bright blaze
of a Carolina sun the united rays of true Irish manhood and Irish
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>intelligence.... At the base of our organization is one
grand permeating idea, to give character and worth and potency to
the Irishman in America. It was this society which built the first
Irish-American hall in the United States.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The gallant and distinguished Gen. M. C. Butler, in response to
inquiries about his family, writes from his home at Edgefield, S. C.:</p>

<p class='c006'>“I have been absent from home for a fortnight, and did not receive
your letter in regard to the Irish-Americans in our late war
from this state in time to aid you.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I have a typewritten copy of the family history of the Butlers of
my family, and would send that to you, but it is the only copy, and
therefore do not like to risk it, as it is doubtless too late for your
purpose. The Pierce Butler to whom you refer was of the same
stock as my great-grandfather, James Butler, who came here from
Prince Williams county, Virginia, sometime before the Revolution.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Another branch moved to Kentucky, to which Gen. Wm. O.
Butler belonged and also Col. E. G. W. Butler of Louisiana. They
have always been a ‘fighting’ people—the cropping out of their
Irish blood—and have taken a hand in all the wars of our past history.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I think the most distinguished and conspicuous military man of
my immediate family was my uncle, Col. Pierce M. Butler, who was
killed at the head of the Palmetto Regiment on the 20th of August,
1847, at Churubusco, in Mexico. I have always understood he was
held in the highest estimation by General Scott, and other general
officers of rank in the United States army.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I should think Armstrong, that witty, devil-may-care gallant
Irishman of Charleston, could give you valuable information of the
part the Irish-Americans of this state bore in the Confederate
armies. He is himself a conspicuous example of their gallantry and
patriotism.”</p>

<p class='c006'>I publish the following extracts from letters of Col. James Armstrong,
of Charleston, S. C., just mentioned, than whom there was no
more gallant soldier in the army of Northern Virginia:</p>

<p class='c006'>“Gen. John Rutledge, of Revolutionary fame, was of Irish descent.
So were the Mannings, three of whom served as governors of the
state. Judge J. Belton O’Neill, Judges Johnstone and Caldwell,
James L. Pettigrew, George McDuffie, Governor Patrick Noble,
Gen. John Barnwell, who defeated the Tuscarora Indians, were of
the same race. The Rhetts are descendants of the renowned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>‘Irish Rebel,’ Roger Moore. Judge A. E. Burke, who fought in
1776, and was afterward judge in South Carolina, was an Irishman.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The most prominent South Carolina Irishman in the war of
1812 was, as you know, Andrew Jackson. In the Mexican war
Col. Pierce Butler, who was killed in command of the famous Palmetto
Regiment, was of Irish extraction. This regiment was in
Shields’ Brigade. Patrick Leonard was color-bearer. Many other
Irishmen were in the regiment.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Charleston had several Irish companies in the Confederate army.
Nearly every company had Irishmen. The flags of the first fourteen
regiments, McGowan’s Brigade, were the first Confederate colors to
enter the town of Gettysburg. The Irish Volunteers was the color
company of the First Regiment and the flag was borne into the
town by the captain of the company, the color-bearer having been
shot.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Capt. John Mitchell, son of the Irish patriot, was in command
of Fort Sumter. He had developed superb courage on the ramparts
and was struck by a shell.</p>

<p class='c006'>“There were two regiments of South Carolina regulars; about
half of the men were Irish. The middle and up-country regiments
contained hundreds of the descendants of our race.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Generals Wade Hampton and M. E. Butler have Irish blood.
Gen. James Connor and Gen. Samuel McGowan were of Irish
descent. Also Col. Edward McCrady and Capt. W. H. Ryan and
Capt. A. A. Allemong, Capts. M. P. Parker, James Mulvaney, John
C. Mitchell and Sergeant Dominick Spellman, who was another
Sergeant Jasper, were born in Ireland.”</p>

<p class='c006'>After the rebellion of ’98, in Ireland, a number of Irishmen emigrated
to Georgia. Several families settled in Augusta. The Irish
and their descendants are to be found in all the Southern cities
on the coast, and in the interior from Washington to Galveston.</p>

<p class='c006'>There were two distinguished lawyers and jurists of Irish birth in
Georgia—Judge John Erskine and Judge O. A. Lochrane. Judge
Lochrane was a wonderfully gifted man. He had great personal
magnetism and unusual powers of brilliant eloquence. He had a
handsome person, a noble head and a pleasing countenance. He
had a wonderful memory, the imagination of a poet and all the
graces of oratory. He was called the Irish orator. With brilliancy
and depth and familiarity with the principles of law, he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>coped successfully with the ablest lawyers before the highest tribunals.
As chief justice he made a fine reputation. As lawyer, judge
and business man his career was eminently successful. It is with
laudable pride I speak of him as a Georgian and an Irishman.</p>

<p class='c006'>Judge Erskine was appointed judge of the United States court in
Georgia, in 1865, by President Andrew Johnson. Of him it might
well be said his wisdom enabled him to temper his justice with
moderation. Honest integrity and an inflexible regard for rectitude,
and the recognition of his sterling worth, made him honored
even by those who opposed him politically, and won for him the
love and respect of his friends. It may truly be said, “He never
forsook a friend, nor forgot a favor.” After nearly twenty years of
service he retired from the bench in 1883, with the universal
esteem of his associates at the bar. He deservedly attained a place
among the honored roll of Georgia’s worthiest sons.</p>

<p class='c006'>There was the brilliant and lamented Henry W. Grady, journalist,
orator and patriot, whose grandfather was named O’Grady and
whose father died on the field of battle at the head of his company,
fighting for the Confederacy. The South had no more gifted son.
He was proud of his Irish blood. His untimely death was a public
bereavement. His genius and his talents have won for him a lasting
fame.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Hon. Alexander H. Stephens and the Hon. Joseph E. Brown
were two of the most distinguished sons of Georgia. Mr. Stephens
had Irish blood in his veins and Governor Brown’s ancestors emigrated
from the north of Ireland to South Carolina. These were
two of the wisest and greatest of Georgians. They were proud of
their Irish blood and were the life-long friends of Ireland and the
Irish people. They fought intolerance and proscription and stood
boldly for the great principles of civil and religious liberty.</p>

<p class='c006'>Irish names are common in the Southern states. In many
instances the people who have them are removed several generations
from the immigrants, thus showing that the Irish immigrant
pushed his way into the South in the early settlement of the
country.</p>

<p class='c006'>A host of Irish-Americans in Georgia during the war were true to
the Confederacy, and fought for its independence. Augusta sent
the Irish Volunteers into the field under Captain Harvey Hull, who
was succeeded by Captain T. G. Barrett. The last captain was M.
J. O’Connor. This company had 100 volunteers. The men fought
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>gallantly in the Army of Tennessee until the close of the war.
Capt. Matt. Rice, a native of Ireland, commanded the Confederate
Light Guards, in the Army of Northern Virginia. He left a leg at
Gettysburg. There were twenty-five Irishmen in this company.
The other companies from Augusta contained Irishmen. They
were in the Clinch Rifles, the Oglethorpes and the Hussars.</p>

<p class='c006'>There are numbers of Irishmen in Augusta who illustrated Irish
valor and patriotism in the Confederate army. I regret that I have
not the space to mention in detail the names of the Irishmen of
Augusta who served the South during the war.</p>

<p class='c006'>Hon. A. D. Candler, secretary of state, is proud of his Irish
descent. He writes:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Col. Robert McMillan, of the Twenty-fourth Georgia Infantry,
went from Habersham county and was a gallant officer. He was
born in Ireland, as was his brother, a gallant private in a company
commanded by my father, who was himself of Irish lineage.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Col. McMillan’s son, Garnett, was born in Elbert county,
Georgia, but was of pure Irish blood. He was major of his father’s
regiment and a splendid soldier. He was elected to congress in
1872, but died before he took his seat.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I am of Irish extraction on both sides, I am proud to say. I
I was first a private, then a lieutenant and then a captain, and finally
a colonel in the Confederate army.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Captain and afterward Lieutenant-Colonel Neal, of this city,
was an Irish-American and a good officer, who died in battle. He
was a brother-in-law of Capt. John Keely, a gallant officer whom
you knew. At this moment I recall no other officers who were of
Irish blood.</p>

<p class='c012'>“There were others who were privates in the ranks, and every
one without exception was a good soldier. Indeed, I have a thousand
times thought of, and with pride endorsed, the language of the
King of Poland, who said of the Irish that ‘there is nowhere on the
face of the earth a people among whom there are so few fools and
cowards.’”</p>

<p class='c010'>Captain John Flannery, a native of Ireland, who commanded the
Irish Jasper Greens in the Civil War, writes:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Savannah furnished to the Georgia regiment for the Mexican
War one company of volunteers, something over ninety men, a very
large majority of them natural-born Irishmen. That company was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>the Irish Jasper Greens, under Captain Henry R. Jackson, who, on
being promoted, was succeeded by Captain John McMahon, a native-born
Irishman.</p>

<p class='c012'>“In the late war I estimate that Savannah furnished about 1,000
men of Irish birth to the armies of the Confederate states. Nearly
three fourths of these served in distinctively Irish companies, of
which there were seven. As to their services in the field, that
would be too long a story, even if I had the data, to write in a letter.
The Irish element held up their end of the line in every duty that
devolved upon them on the march, in the battlefield, or elsewhere,
during the four years of the great struggle.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Gen. John B. Gordon writes:</p>

<p class='c011'>“I had on my staff Major Mitchell, a son of the Irish patriot
John Mitchell, and who was one of the most gallant soldiers in the
Confederate army. He had in him the patriotic fire, the ardent
love of liberty and the devotion to principle which characterized his
distinguished father. He was desperately wounded in battle, but
recovered and served to the close. He was always at the post of
duty and in every particular an ideal soldier.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Mr. P. J. Moran of Atlanta says:</p>

<p class='c011'>“In answer to your question concerning the action of the Irish in
Atlanta during the war, I have obtained the following facts: The
priest here at the time was Rev. Father Hassan, a born Irishman.
Of course he took no immediate part in politics. When the agitation
came up leading to secession, the Irishmen of Atlanta were
almost a unit against it, but, after the ordinance was passed, they
accepted the command of the state. Immediately upon the passage
of the ordinance the native Georgians appeared on the streets wearing
cockades; and the <cite>Intelligencer</cite> appeared next morning with the
inquiry: ‘What’s the Matter With the Irish That They are not
Wearing Cockades?’</p>

<p class='c012'>“The answer came during the day: ‘We fight; but do not flaunt
ribbons.’</p>

<p class='c012'>“And before the day was over the Jackson Guards, composed of
eighty-five Irishmen, was organized, made up from the clerks of
the stores of John Ryan, Meyers and Hayden. They elected as
captain, William O’Halloran, one of the bravest soldiers that ever
lived. His deafness interfered with his service, however, and
James H. Neal, brother of Capt. T. B. Neal, now of Atlanta, was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>elected to the captaincy, with Dennis S. Meyers, John Keely, Peter
Fenelon and John McGhee as lieutenants. This company went
through the war hardly ever missing a battle, and when hostilities
were concluded, the remnant came back home—eleven men out of
the eighty-five, who had gone to the front. In thus directing the
action of the Irish people of Atlanta, Father Hassan was prominent.
The policy was to be true to the Union while it lasted; but when
the state spoke—it then became their duty to do what they could.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Gen. Clement A. Evans, one of the best and bravest officers of
the Confederate army, sends the following:</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is a pleasure I have in answering your letter to say that I am
proud of my Irish blood and wish that it may flow on forever. You
are to take part in an interesting occasion at Nashville designed to
bring before our American people the value of the generous, brave,
honorable Irishmen. Your familiarity with our American history
will serve you well; much of it was made by Irish valor.</p>

<p class='c012'>“In our Confederate war the Irish were on both sides, winning
distinction in both armies—and it is not at all strange that the two
Irish sides were both right. No other people on earth except the
Irish can espouse opposite sides and both be right. A brave and
true Confederate Irishman was captured near Manassas Junction by
a scouting party of soldiers. He chanced to be dressed in no
uniform and betrayed by no sign that he belonged to any particular
side of the pending military issue.</p>

<p class='c012'>“The captors demanded of him, ‘Where do you belong? What’s
your command?’ ‘By me faith,’ said Mike, ‘it’s an ugly question
ye are asking and I’d be after asking ye by your leave the same
thing.’ ‘Well,’ said the scouts, ‘we are Lincoln’s men.’ ‘All right,’
said Mike very warmly, ‘I took ye for gentlemen, an I’m the same.’
But the scouts thinking they had caught him, seized him and said,
‘You are our prisoner. We belong to Lee’s army.’ ‘Thin ye told
me a lie, just now, boys, as I thought ye would, and I told ye one
meself. Now tell me the truth, and I’ll tell ye the truth.’ ‘Well,
then, we belong to the state of South Carolina.’ ‘So do I,’ quickly
and with enthusiasm, ‘and I belong to all the other states of the
country, too; and I bate the whole of you in that one thing. Do
you think I would come all the way from Ireland to belong to one
state when I have the right to belong to the whole of them?’
Mike’s Unionism was broader than that of nearly all the statesmen
of that period.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>“In the beginning of the war the Irish boys who were scattered
over the South fell in with the companies as they were formed....
One company went from my native county, Stewart, electing
for its captain a young Irishman, Captain Mike Lynch, who
made a reputation in the 21st Georgia regiment of Dole’s Brigade
for skilful courage and kindness known throughout the command.
Captain Lynch was full-blooded Irish, with all the mellow accent
of the Emerald Isle. I do not think a braver, truer man fought in
any army.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Captain James Mitchell, son of the Irish exile, served with me
directly on my staff. He was a brilliant young gentleman, graceful
in bearing, handsome and of unsurpassed courage. His battle
record is as good as that of our bravest men. His brother (I think)
served in Charleston as captain at Fort Sumter. His father was a
very ardent supporter of secession. Capt. James Mitchell expressed
to me, at the battle of Fredericksburg, his deep regret that Confederate
Irishmen were confronted by Meagher’s brave command.</p>

<p class='c012'>“There were a considerable number of Irish troops in Louisiana
regiments. Some of them were under me while I commanded a
division composed of Georgia, Virginia and Louisiana brigades.
There were no men ... easier to lead in battle than these
Louisiana Irishmen. I saw many examples of that superb Irish
dash about which I had read much in history and romance of
European wars.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I participated in the late afternoon and evening assault at
Gettysburg on Lee’s left, when the Irish fighters on the Confederate
side went to their death with a heroism at which I wondered.
You have, of course, looked into the history of Meagher’s Irish
Brigade.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I was in the battle of Fredericksburg on the Confederate left
wing, and engaged the same day when that brigade was led (at
another part of the field) to slaughter. I think that there was a
cruelty in the plan of Federal attack which cannot be excused. If
I remember aright the splendid brigade was nearly destroyed.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Meagher’s Brigade was specially prominent at Gaines’ Mill (or
Cold Harbor), June 27; at Antietam (Sharpsburg), September 17,
and at Fredericksburg, December 13, 1862. The United States government
has never sufficiently recognized the services of that brigade.
I wish our friend Fleming would have a resolution passed in
congress to show that appreciation of their valor which has never
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>been accorded. I suppose that Burnside’s friends did not want to
go too deeply into the story of the fearful error which he made.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Pat Cleburne is a name which is as lovingly mentioned among
us who are soldiers as the name of Stonewall Jackson. He was
actually loved by the army in the West, where he was best known.
Cleburne was killed in the Confederate assault on the desperately
defended trenches of the Federals at Franklin, Tenn., November
30, 1864. President Davis said: ‘Around Cleburne thickly lay
the gallant men who in his desperate assault followed him with the
implicit confidence that in another army was given to Stonewall
Jackson, and in the one case as in the other, a vacancy was created
which could never be filled.’</p>

<p class='c012'>“I write immediately on reading your letter and on the idea that
you simply want matters of my own memory. Some investigation
would lead to a very interesting story of the Irish-Americans in our
American wars, which I have been sometimes thinking of writing.</p>

<p class='c012'>“You will not forget that Father Ryan gave us the sweetest of our
Southern poetry. I think also that the clergy in both armies should
not be forgotten in any account of the Confederate struggle.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Col. C. C. Sanders of Gainesville, colonel of the 24th Georgia,
favors me with a graphic description of the charge of Meagher’s
Irish Brigade. He says:</p>

<p class='c011'>“The writer was an eye witness to the charge of the Irish brigade
at Fredericksburg. General Lee had, at the time, the finest army
in history. Two formidable lines of battle were protected by a rock
wall and defended by Cobb’s and Kershaw’s brigades of McLaw’s
division (one-fourth of whom, I suppose, were Irishmen or of Irish
extraction), and the famous Washington Artillery. In our immediate
front one could walk on the dead for hundreds of yards. We
were pained to see the noble fellows coming up in steady columns
to be mowed down before our lines of solid flames of fire from our
entrenched position behind the rock wall and the terrible fire from
the Washington Artillery on Marie’s Hill, just in our rear and commanding
every inch of approach.</p>

<p class='c012'>“The Irish Brigade would receive our well-directed fire steady
and firm, and when great gaps were cut through their ranks by
the artillery, would reform under the incessant fire, come again,
sink down and rise again, trample the dead and wounded under
foot and press the stone wall of liquid fire, then recede a few feet
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>and come again, like an avalanche into the very jaws of death,
until strength and endurance failed, having been forced back by
shell and the deadly miniè ball that no human being could withstand.
The field of battle ran great streams of blood, and the
immortal Irish Brigade recoiled before the living wall of fire in
glory.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I know of no charge upon the field of battle in history to
compare to the charge of the Irish Brigade at Fredericksburg,
unless it was Pickett’s Division at Gettysburg, or the Old Guard
at Waterloo. The immortal Irish Brigade were soldiers indeed.
I have heard, but I do not know whether it is correct, that after the
Fredericksburg battle the United States government mustered
out the Irish Brigade from service and placed all upon the pension
roll. You can examine records or see for yourself as to its
correctness. I have always felt proud of my one-fourth Irish blood.
The Irish have fought the battles of all countries. I wish you
success in your address, and three cheers for the Immortal Irish
Brigade!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Lieut. Gen. Longstreet says of the charge of Meagher’s Brigade:
“The manner in which Meagher’s Irish Brigade breasted
the death storm from Marie’s Heights of Fredericksburg, was the
handsomest thing in the whole war. Six times in the face of a
withering fire, before which whole ranks were mowed down as corn
before the sickle, did the Irish Brigade run up that hill—rush to
inevitable death.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Said the adjutant-general of Hancock’s staff: “I looked with
my field glasses, and I looked for a long time before I was certain
of what I saw. I at first thought that the men of Meagher’s Brigade
had lain down to allow the shower of shot and shell to pass
over them, for they lay in regular lines. I looked for some movement,
some stir—a hand or foot in motion; but no—they were
dead—dead, every man of them.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The following contribution from Mr. John L. Rapier, of the
<cite>Mobile Register</cite>, is highly appreciated: “When you ask me for the
names and deeds of glory of Irishmen and sons of Irishmen, in
peace and war, ’tis like putting one in the Klondike fields and asking
him to pick up the nuggets of gold that lie round about him. The
field of my memory is full of them. To be brief as possible:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Theodore O’Hara, poet, writer, one of the editors of the <cite>Mobile
Register</cite>, wrote the immortal poem, ‘The Bivouac of the Dead,’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>adopted now by the government. The verses are cast in bronze
and cut in marble and used in every National cemetery in the
country.</p>

<p class='c012'>“The ‘Silver-tongued orator of the Chattahoochee,’ Gen. Alpheus
Baker, of Eufaula, Ala., possibly the most wonderful orator that ever
lived within the borders of our state.</p>

<p class='c012'>“General Finnegan, the hero of Olustee, Fla. I suppose you
have him on your list already.</p>

<p class='c012'>“General O’Neal, ‘Old Tige,’ as the boys called him, after the
war, governor of Alabama; a great old soldier and statesman.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Every company of the Third Alabama had in its ranks a generous
infusion of Irish blood, and one company, the Emerald Guards,
was composed entirely of Irishmen. This company lost three captains
during the war: Captain Loughry, killed at Seven Pines;
Captain Branigan, killed at Gettysburg; and Captain McGrath, desperately
wounded at Williamsburg, Second Manassas, the Wilderness
and Spottsylvania, was brought home to die—perfectly shattered
by the enemy’s bullets; no hazardous or extra duty performed
by the gallant Third, but what her Irish members had their full
share.</p>

<p class='c012'>“The Sixth Alabama had an Irish company, the ‘Montgomery
Grays.’ This company carried to Virginia 103 men. It is declared
that but eleven of this number returned after the war, and not one of
these eleven returned unscathed. I am not familiar with the history
of the Mississippi troops and never met many of the men from
that state.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Of Louisiana, I recall that Wheat’s Tigers, the First Regiment
of Louisiana Regulars (Gen. Gladden’s regiment); the First Regiment
of Louisiana Volunteers and the Fourteenth Regiment Louisiana
Volunteers were almost entirely composed of Irishmen and the
sons of Irishmen. Nearly every regiment from that state had a fair
sprinkling of the same blood. Even the famous Louisiana Zouaves
and St. Paul’s Chasseurs, generally supposed to be entirely French,
were more than one-third Irish. It always astonished me to see
how accurately these Celts could obey an order given in French,
especially when that order was ‘<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">En avant</span></i>’—i. e., ‘Forward.’ And
did these gallant battalions furnish heroic soldiers? My dear sir, I
could write a column on the subject.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Shall I pick out one and tell you of him? Then, without effort,
I select ‘Mike Nolan’—Gen. Mike Nolan. When I was a little boy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>around New Orleans, I used to collect bills for sugar at a small grocery,
right opposite the Charity hospital in that city. The owner of
the store was a young, blue-eyed, light-haired Irishman, named
Mike Nolan. Mild and polite and friendly in his manners; and I
am sure it is no shame to my foresight that at that time I did not
recognize in him the to be best, bravest and grandest soldier I ever
met.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Nolan left New Orleans as a sergeant in one of the companies of
the First Louisiana Volunteers; he quickly rose to a lieutenancy,
then captain, lieutenant-colonel and colonel. He commanded his regiment
with great bravery and ability. He was wounded at Sharpsburg,
where he assumed command of his brigade upon the death of
General Stark, who was killed in that battle. General Nolan’s
commission as brigadier had not reached him when he was killed
at Gettysburg.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Full, full of glory is the history of the Irishmen and the sons of
Irishmen in Louisiana, in every branch of life, in the press, in the
professions, in commerce, in the church and in deeds of valor upon
the battlefields of Mexico and the South.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Gen. Wm. B. Bate, the able and distinguished senator from Tennessee,
has furnished me with an important contribution with regard
to the loyalty and gallantry of such Irishmen and Irish-Americans
as were connected with the Confederate army.</p>

<p class='c006'>To give the military career of such men would require a volume.
There were no more loyal and gallant men in the Confederate army,
both as soldiers and officers, and none was truer to our cause and
stood by our little flag with its stars and bars and cross of St.
Andrew, from the beginning to the ending, with more fidelity, pride
and patriotism than did the Irishmen and Irish-Americans who
were enlisted in the Confederate army.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Irishman who won the most distinction on the Confederate
side and gained the highest rank was Major-General Patrick R. Cleburne.
He was formerly a private in the English army and when
his connection with it ceased he came to this country and at the
time of the breaking out of the war was a practising lawyer in
Helena, Arkansas. He assisted in raising a regiment of Arkansas
troops and became its colonel. His regiment was united with the
Army of Tennessee, was at Bowling Green, Ky., in General Hardee’s
command, under Gen. Albert Sidney Johnson, and went with it to
Shiloh.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>General Cleburne commanded a brigade that day composed principally
of Tennesseeans, which fought in Hardee’s corps and which
composed the front line of battle. General Bate’s regiment, the
Second Tennessee Infantry, C. S. A., composed its extreme left.
He was from that time on identified with the Army of Tennessee and
its campaigns and battles. He was subsequently promoted and
commanded what is known as Cleburne’s Division, was an active
and efficient factor in the Army of Tennessee until he was killed in
the charge on the Federal breastworks at Franklin, November
30, 1864.</p>

<p class='c006'>Next to him in our army was Brigadier-General R. C. Tyler, an
Irishman by birth and an American by adoption. Gen. Tyler
was living in Memphis as a levee contractor when the war broke
out and enlisted as a private, became quartermaster of his regiment,
went with it into the battle of Belmont, its first engagement, and so
distinguished himself that it was but a short time until he was made
colonel, and on its consolidation with the Thirty-seventh he became
colonel commanding the consolidation. The regiment was assigned
to General Bate’s original brigade and Tyler was a part of it as
colonel until after the battle of Chickamauga, in which he again
distinguished himself and under the recommendation of General
Bate he was made brigadier-general and put in command of his old
brigade, Bate having been in the meanwhile promoted to a major-generalship.</p>

<p class='c006'>General Tyler was wounded at Missionary Ridge and being unfit
for field duty, was assigned to the command at West Point, Ga. He
was in command of the fort there when the surrender of Generals
Lee and Johnston’s armies took place. When General Wilson with
his cavalry demanded a surrender of the fort, Tyler refused to give
it up, though with but a handful of men against thousands, and fell
while defiantly fighting against such odds rather than surrender.</p>

<p class='c006'>Col. Grace, of the Tenth Tennessee, was an Irishman, a splendid
soldier, and was killed at the head of his regiment at the battle of
Jonesboro’, Ga. Lieutenant-Colonel O’Neil, of the same regiment,
a brave soldier, survived the war but died since. Company E
of the Second Tennessee Regiment was a company composed of
Irishmen enlisted by Captain Casper W. Hunt and served most gallantly
throughout the entire war. This company and the Tenth and
Fifteenth regiments were all in Gen. Bate’s command and composed
of Irishmen, and no command made better records than did they.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>Senator Bate says the grandest and greatest Irishman in the
Confederacy was John Mitchell. He who was banished in
“Lurid—’48” and condemned to fourteen years’ imprisonment. He
was sent to an English penal colony from which he subsequently
escaped and came to the United States by the Pacific route and
finally settled down near Knoxville, Tenn.</p>

<p class='c006'>When the war broke out he was editing a paper in Knoxville, and
was appointed an assistant secretary to one of the governmental
departments at Richmond by Jefferson Davis. He had three sons,
two of whom were killed in the armies of the Confederate states
and one who still lives in New York City.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mitchell was a brilliant writer and author and was imprisoned by
the Federals at Fort Warren at the close of the war. He was finally
released and after a few years returned to Ireland and was elected
by the “Bloody Tips” to the British Parliament, but was denied his
seat. He was reëlected and died during the pendency of his contest
for the seat.</p>

<p class='c006'>Thomas W. Wrenne, president of the Irish-American Centennial
Association, has furnished me with information relative to the troops
Tennessee gave to the Confederate cause and to the Union army:</p>

<p class='c006'>To the Confederate states Tennessee gave (all volunteers),
108,000.</p>

<p class='c006'>To the Federal government Tennessee gave (all volunteers),
31,092.</p>

<p class='c006'>Possibly, excepting North Carolina, Tennessee gave more troops to
the Confederate states in proportion to the population than any other.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is worthy of note that North Carolina is populated in a great
measure like Tennessee with Irish-American people. You know
that most of the Tennessee early settlers came over from North
Carolina and both have always been patriotic.</p>

<p class='c006'>You will be agreeably surprised with the number of Irish-Americans
among the great men of Tennessee. Andrew Jackson, James
K. Polk, Davy Crockett, Sam Houston (I think Andrew Johnson),
and General John Adams were Irish-Americans.</p>

<p class='c006'>The father and mother of General John Adams came direct from
Ireland and settled in Nashville. Their son was graduated from
West Point. When the last war began he gave his services to the
C. S. A. He was a gallant and brave soldier. His death on horseback
on the top of the Federal breastworks at Franklin was as remarkable
a piece of heroism as the war witnessed.</p>

  <h2 id='HUGH' class='c004'>HUGH CARGILL, A FRIEND OF LIBERTY.</h2>
</div>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div><span class='small'>BY THOMAS F. O’MALLEY, SOMERVILLE, MASS.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Hugh Cargill was born in Ballyshannon, Donegal, Ireland, about
1739, and came to Boston in 1774, “in connection with the British
troops”<a id='r25' /><a href='#f25' class='c016'><sup>[25]</sup></a>—probably a soldier in one of the regiments. Concerning
his early life in Boston little is known other than that he soon
espoused the cause of the patriots and left the British service. April
19, 1775, found him at Concord, Mass., with the Provincial forces.
When the enemy fired the court house and endangered the records,
Cargill, with one Bullock, assisted in removing them to a place of
safety.<a id='r26' /><a href='#f26' class='c016'><sup>[26]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The events of that day hastened the recruiting of companies and
the formation of regiments. Cargill at once joined Capt. Abishia
Brown’s company which had been raised in the region around Concord
and Lexington. His military experience and training made
him a valuable man in the newly-organized command, and he was at
once made a non-commissioned officer, being the fourth in the list of
sergeants of the company.<a id='r27' /><a href='#f27' class='c016'><sup>[27]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Captain Brown’s company was attached to Colonel Nixon’s Middlesex
County regiment and was one of the few companies of that
command engaged at Bunker Hill.</p>

<p class='c006'>At the conclusion of his service in the army Mr. Cargill settled in
Boston and engaged in the business of a taverner or inn-keeper. In
the first Boston Directory (1789) he is described as a “retailer” with
a place of business on Cambridge street. After many years of close
application to business, and by careful management and economy, he
accumulated considerable money.</p>

<p class='c006'>In 1790 he purchased from David Hyde the estate in which he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>carried on his business.<a id='r28' /><a href='#f28' class='c016'><sup>[28]</sup></a> The property consisted of a two-story
house on the westerly side of Cambridge street and bounded southerly
on Alden lane. In 1798 at the time of the levy of the direct
tax it was valued at $3,300.<a id='r29' /><a href='#f29' class='c016'><sup>[29]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>While in business, Mr. Cargill was active in the affairs of the community
and was especially interested in the local fire companies.
On April 26, 1786, he was proposed to the selectmen, by Capt.
Edward Ridgeway, for membership in his engine company, and
“approved.”<a id='r30' /><a href='#f30' class='c016'><sup>[30]</sup></a> Ridgeway’s company was known as No. 6 and
was a noted one at that time. Cargill remained with this company
for some years, for as late as 1790 we find his name on the list of
members returned to the selectmen.<a id='r31' /><a href='#f31' class='c016'><sup>[31]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>During the early part of the year 1790 Mr. Cargill retired, and sold
his business to one Smith Coleman, evidently a fellow-countryman.
In June, 1790, we find the latter applying for a license to sell spirituous
liquors at the house on Cambridge street “which was licensed
last year under the improvement of Hugh Cargill who is removed.”<a id='r32' /><a href='#f32' class='c016'><sup>[32]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>After his retirement from business Mr. Cargill spent some years
in Boston, during which he invested in lands in Woburn, Westford,
Carlisle and other surrounding towns.</p>

<p class='c006'>Early in 1796 he took up his residence in historic Concord. There
the early days of his life on this side of the Atlantic had been spent;
there he saw his first service as an American soldier, and there he
was destined to end his days. In April, 1797, he purchased an extensive
tract of land “near the middle of the town,” known as the
Stratton farm, and made it his home.<a id='r33' /><a href='#f33' class='c016'><sup>[33]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>On November 27, 1798, he married Rebecca, daughter of Robert
Estabrook, of Concord, the knot being tied by the Rev. Ezra Ripley.<a id='r34' /><a href='#f34' class='c016'><sup>[34]</sup></a>
Mr. Cargill’s wedded life was, unfortunately, brief. Within two
weeks after his marriage he was seized with an illness which ended
his life on January 12, 1799.<a id='r35' /><a href='#f35' class='c016'><sup>[35]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>His will, which is on file in the probate office at Cambridge, Mass.,
bears the date of December 6, 1798, and was witnessed by Jacob
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>Brown, Obadiah Hall and Paul Adams. The last named married
the widow.<a id='r36' /><a href='#f36' class='c016'><sup>[36]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>By the will his widow was given the “free use and improvement of
all the real estate,” that he should die possessed of, during her natural
life or so long as she remained his widow. Upon her decease or
marriage he gave the Cambridge street estate to Samuel Chamberlain,
providing he pay to Hugh Cargill Maloney, son of Cornelius Maloney
of Boston, and Hugh Cargill Barrett, son of Benjamin Barrett
of Carlisle, each the sum of three hundred and thirty-three dollars
and thirty-three cents. The remainder of the estate, the will continues:</p>

<p class='c006'>“I give and bequeath to the inhabitants of the town of Concord
and successors forever the residue of my real estate that I shall dye
seized of in said Commonwealth of Massachusetts; to come into
possession of the same at the decease or marriage of my wife above
named and not before and the income thereof to be solely applied
for the support of the poor of said town of Concord, and my will is
that the care of the principal and income of said estate be under
the particular direction of the selectmen of Concord for the time
being; and that the said income be uniformly and annually delivered
by them to the poor of said town to whom they shall think the
proper objects of it; the sale of part of said estate if thought best
by the inhabitants of Concord when they are in possession and the
interest of the money coming by said sale to be applied as above
ordered I am content with: But the farm I give to the town, called
the Stratton farm, lying in the middle of the town of Concord, I
entail the same to be improved as a poor house and the land to be
improved by and for the benefit of the poor; and to be under the
special direction and care of the overseers of the poor of the town
of Concord for the time being for the purposes afore<sup>sd</sup> for ever.”</p>

<p class='c006'>His widow, Rebecca Cargill, on December 27, 1800, in anticipation
of her marriage to Paul Adams (which occurred August 2, 1801),
executed releases to the town of all her interest in the estate devised,
and thus vested the gift.<a id='r37' /><a href='#f37' class='c016'><sup>[37]</sup></a> The estate is still used as a poor farm.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mr. Cargill’s remains rest on the westerly slope of the Old Hill
burial ground in Concord, close by the grave of his wife, Rebecca
Cargill Adams, who died March 5, 1838. His grave is marked by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>a slab surmounted by an urn in relief, on which is inscribed the initials
of his name. Beneath is the following inscription:<a id='r38' /><a href='#f38' class='c016'><sup>[38]</sup></a></p>

  <h2 id='THE3' class='c004'>THE IRISH SETTLERS OF PELHAM, MASS.</h2>
</div>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div><span class='small'>BY MARY LESSEY LINEHAN, HARTFORD, CONN.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Almost every civil war, rebellion, insurrection, and outbreak in
Ireland, from the time of the Tudors downwards, arose more or less
directly from questions connected with the possession of lands. It
was the land question which helped to drive the Presbyterian Irish
out, to become pioneer Irish settlers in America. Whole villages of
Irish people were depopulated.</p>

<p class='c006'>These clearances gave vast numbers of Irish settlers to America
before the Revolutionary War, and supplied the American army
with a body of brave, determined men. Massachusetts received a
very large proportion of the Irish in the eighteenth century, and
being far the most important of the old colonies, the history of its
early settlement is, consequently, interesting.</p>

<p class='c006'>One of the most interesting inland settlements in the state of
Massachusetts is the town of Pelham, situated in the northwestern
part of Hampshire county, settled by Irish immigrants in 1738‒9.
An historical spot, as it was the dwelling place of that patriotic soldier,
Daniel Shea, who, after the Revolution, was one of the leaders
in “Shays’ Rebellion.”</p>

<p class='c006'>In 1738 Robert Peibles, blacksmith, and James Thornton, yeoman,
two Irish immigrants, made a contract with Col. John Stoddard
of Northampton, Mass., for the purchase of his section of “Equivalent
Lands,” with the purpose of establishing thereon a colony of
settlers “who shall be such as were inhabitants of the Kingdom of
Ireland or their descendants.”</p>

<p class='c006'>This contract having been carried into effect, Colonel Stoddard
sold the land to Robert Peibles, Patrick Peibles, James Thornton,
Andrew McFarland and others named in the deed. These with
their families became the first settlers of Pelham. Among the early
settlers are the familiar Celtic names, McCullough, McCullom,
McConkey, Dick, Taylor, Gray, McClain, Breckenridge, Gilmore,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>Macklan, McLachay, McNutt, McConnell, Cochran, Savage, Hamilton,
McMullen, McCartney, Joyce, Rankin, White, McFall, Butler,
Felton, Hoar, Griffin, Kelley, McNiell, McLallen, McClintock.</p>

<p class='c006'>The new settlement was called New Lisburn, after the town of
Lisburn in the southern part of County Antrim, on the banks of the
Lagan, in Ireland. Some of the settlers coming from Lisburn
wished to call their new home after the mother town, and until 1743
the settlement was called New Lisburn, when it was changed to
Pelham.</p>

<p class='c006'>At the time of the purchase the condition of the soil was more
fertile than at present. Rye, oats, corn, and barley were raised in
abundance, as well as flax. The hills furnished excellent pasturage
for cattle and horses. The settlers were a quiet, honest, Godfearing
people. The town grew very slowly. In 1776 the population
was 729. In 1800, 1,144. Since the latter date it has
decreased in population.</p>

<p class='c006'>When the trouble arose between England and the colonies, the
town of Pelham was one of the first to answer a communication
from the Committee of Correspondence in Boston. A few literal
extracts are interesting:</p>

<p class='c006'>“To the Committee of Correspondence, Gentlemen: We have
considered your Circular letters and are not a little shoked at the
attempts upon the liberties of America ... we replied back
also upon the unhappy Reign of the Stuart family &amp; bloody Struggles
to subdue a free people to Non-resistance and Passive obedience.
We have still a more sense of the worth of our Liberties
by the total loss of them in the conquered Kingdom of Ireland
when altho made of the same one Blood they have a yoke of Iron
put upon their Necks and they must serve their conquerors with as
much of their money and blood as they are pleased to demand and
sustain more intolerable oppressions from these Legislative Masters
and unfeeling Landlords than some of the Barbarious Nations compared
by the Ancient Romans before the wars of their Empire.</p>

<p class='c006'>“This so grievous a yoke upon the Western Isle which neither
they nor their fathers were able to bear has driven them by hundreds
and by thousands to bide a final adue to their otherwise Dear
Native Land and seek a peaceful Retreat from the bane of Oppressions
in this American Wilderness. Depending upon the faith of
the Nation for all the privileges chartered to American Colonies,
we cannot therefore but be greatly alarmed at the news of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>Incroachments upon the Natural and Chartered Rights of this
Province where we have our abode.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The military history of the town is an honorable one. In the
War of the Revolution a large number of the male residents took
part. At the close of the Revolution the town came into prominence
on account of the part many of its citizens took in “Shays’
Rebellion.” This rebellion was not prompted by any spirit of disloyalty,
nor was it designed or plotted to overturn the government.
It was the wild and lawless expression of discontent with harsh
circumstances, the natural outbreak of those who were suffering and
oppressed.</p>

<p class='c006'>Daniel Shea, one of the leaders in this rebellion, was a remarkable
man. Very little is known about his early life. His birthplace has
been assigned to Hopkinton, Mass., but this has been disputed.
There is a tradition that his parents and young Shea came from
County Cork, Ireland, and that they lived for some time on the
eastern border of Pelham. He spells his name both “Shea” and
“Shays.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Wherever his birthplace was, one thing is certain concerning him,
he hated England and all things English. Little is known concerning
his life in Pelham previous to the Revolution except what is
traditionary.</p>

<p class='c006'>After the battle of Lexington he was among the first to join a
company of minute men. He was promoted for bravery at the
battle of Bunker Hill, and shared in the campaign resulting in Burgoyne’s
surrender. Nothing shows more clearly the loyal spirit of
Daniel Shea than his conduct during the Revolution. He took a
deep interest in a cause which involved the dearest interests of his
country.</p>

<p class='c006'>Shea returned to Pelham at the close of the war, and in 1781 was
chosen by the town as a member of the Committee of Safety. He
was prominent in other town offices up to the time of the insurrection,
and was a respected citizen. The insurrection is a matter of
history and need not be dwelt on here. Out of the one hundred
and fifty men who were captured, fourteen were tried and sentenced
to death, but were afterwards pardoned. After remaining in hiding
for some time, Shea was pardoned. Having received his pardon,
he went to New York state, where all trace of him is lost.</p>

<p class='c006'>That Pelham was a distinctively Irish settlement is clearly shown
on the occasion of the settling of the first pastor, Rev. Robert Abercrombie,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>a Scotchman. Rev. Mr. Abercrombie was educated at
Edinburgh University and came to this country in 1740 as a licensed
preacher. He came to Pelham in 1742. There arose a division at
once in the church. One of the reasons for the division was the
fact of his being a Scotchman and of his demanding rigid adherence
to the doctrines and requirements of the Church of Scotland.</p>

<p class='c006'>The majority of the members of the Presbyterian church of Pelham
wanted an Irish Presbyterian clergyman. After a great deal
of controversy Mr. Abercrombie was settled as a pastor. He was
unfortunate in having a strong element of opposition to contend
against from his first connection with the people of Pelham, as
shown by the strong protest against his settlement. After preaching
a few years he was compelled to resign his pastorate.</p>

<p class='c006'>While the Irish Presbyterians predominated, there were some who
were members of the Church of England and some Roman Catholics.
A spirit of harmony always existed in this community. The
people were peaceable, respecting the rights of others and demanding
the same respect in return.</p>

<p class='c006'>These early settlers brought with them many of the customs and
traditions of the Emerald Isle, and until after the Revolution they
spoke with a rich Irish brogue. In 1765 many of the settlers, who
had become dissatisfied with the soil and other existing conditions,
moved westward, and joining a colony of settlers from Ballibay,
Ireland, helped to found the town of Salem, N. Y.</p>

<p class='c006'>Among the descendants of the early settlers who became noted
were: Ira P. Rankin, collector of the port of San Francisco, appointed
by President Lincoln.</p>

<p class='c006'>Adam Johnson, one of the benefactors of Amherst College, and
for whom the “Johnson Chapel” is named.</p>

<p class='c006'>Dr. Israel Taylor, a leading physician in Amherst, Mass., until
his death in 1890.</p>

<p class='c006'>Ithamar Conkey, for a number of years town clerk of Pelham,
and in 1830 appointed judge of probate. His son, Ithamar F. Conkey,
one of the leading lawyers of the Massachusetts bar, was a resident
of Amherst, Mass., until his death.</p>

<p class='c006'>There are very few of the descendants of the original settlers
living in the town of Pelham to-day.</p>

<p class='c006'>The late James H. Goodwin, a descendant of Abigail Fawcett,
daughter of Thomas Fawcett, had in his possession the oldest record
of Thomas Fawcett’s family. He had special interest in matters
historical, and gathered all the data he could find relating to the
Fawcetts and Smiths. He offered to donate a lot in Riverview
cemetery and share the expense of removing these old pioneers to a
place where their remains could sleep in peace, and rest undisturbed
forevermore.</p>

<p class='c006'>This matter was very dear to his heart, and he contemplated
doing just what has been done, when death claimed him so suddenly
the night of President McKinley’s election in November, 1896.
He had in his possession the original deed granting to Isaac Craig,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>of Pittsburgh, Pa., sections Nos. 23 and 24, in range No. 1, township
No. 5, bought December 6, 1796, the deed being dated at
Philadelphia, Pa., August 30, 1798, signed by John Adams,
president.</p>

<p class='c006'>Also the deed from Isaac Craig to Thomas Fawcett, conveying
the same sections of land containing 1,090 75‒100 acres for the consideration
of $3,651.00 cash; both deeds are in a good state of
preservation, having been written on parchment.</p>

<p class='c006'>These relics had been in possession of John Fawcett of
Wooster, Ohio, and at his death fell into the hands of Mrs. Julia
Humrickhouse, thence to her son George, deceased, and through
his wife, Mrs. Clara B. Humrickhouse, to James H. Goodwin.</p>

<p class='c006'>Thomas Fawcett and his wife, Isabella, were among the earliest
settlers in Chartier’s Valley, Washington county, Pa., and lived
there until about 1795, when they moved to this place, then a part
of the Northwest Territory. His daughter, Abigail Fawcett, married
Joseph Smith, father of the late Wm. G. Smith, and through
this union James H. Goodwin, George S. Goodwin, Henry S. Goodwin,
Homer S. Knowles, Mrs. Jno. N. Taylor, Mrs. Esther Thomas,
Mrs. Louisa Anderson, Mrs. Susan Harker, and all their children,
are descended from Thomas Fawcett.</p>

<p class='c006'>Thomas Fawcett’s eldest son, Joseph, married Esther White,
and their daughter, Elizabeth, married the late George Anderson, on
whose farm Riverview cemetery is located. Of their children four
are living—Matthew Anderson, John Anderson and Miss Lizzie
Anderson of this city,<a id='r42' /><a href='#f42' class='c016'><sup>[42]</sup></a> and Joseph Anderson, living in Colorado.
The children of Thomas Fawcett Anderson, deceased, also live
with their mother in this city. Mary Fawcett, another daughter of
Joseph and Esther White, married William Hill, deceased, and two
of her children are living here—Mrs. Mary Hill-Andrews, of Seventh
street, and George Hill, on the old farm north of town.</p>

<p class='c006'>Julia Fawcett-Humrickhouse was another daughter, and a sister
of Mrs. Anderson and Mrs. Hill. She made her home before her
marriage with her brother John, who married Julia R. Larwell. Miss
Rest Humrickhouse, daughter of Mr. George A. Humrickhouse, this
city, is the only living descendant of this branch of the Fawcett
family.</p>

<p class='c006'>Through Elizabeth Fawcett, who married John Nessly, are descended
Mrs. Matilda Wallace of Hammondsville, Mrs. Judith
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>McCoy of McCoy’s Station, Jefferson county, and Mrs. Nancy
Nessly Winstanley, who was born in Jefferson county and moved to
Cabrey, Ill. Her brother, Rev. John F. Nessly, is a minister of the
Pittsburgh M. E. conference.</p>

  <h2 id='EARLY' class='c004'>EARLY NEW HAMPSHIRE IRISH; SOME PRE-REVOLUTIONARY DENNISES, CORNELIUSES, PATRICKS AND MICHAELS.</h2>
</div>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div><span class='small'>BY HON. JOHN C. LINEHAN.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Among the Christian names common to the Irish people, especially
to those of the Catholic faith, few were more numerous, a century
ago, than those mentioned in the caption to this article. They were
rare among the Scotch, English, or Welsh. None of them was of
Gaelic or old Irish origin. They came to the ancient Irish with
their religion, and, like their faith, have become nationalized.</p>

<p class='c006'>According to Lecky, the conquest of Ireland by Cromwell’s soldiers
was not more complete than the conquest of the soldiers by
their Irish wives; their offspring assumed Irish given names, and
were brought up in the faith of their mothers. This was the subject
of a complaint against the Irish government to Henry Cromwell, the
son of Oliver. How true this may have been, it is needless to discuss,
but the presence of so many in New Hampshire before the
Revolution bearing the names alluded to, is in part evidence of the
truth of what Lecky wrote, and Prendergast commented on, for not
a few of the surnames are English in appearance.</p>

<p class='c006'>Darby Field came to New Hampshire in 1631. The date is so
remote that no attempt has thus far been made to denationalize him.
Consequently, he remains on the records as a plain “Irish soldier for
discovery.” His home was in Exeter. He is credited with being
the first in the English settlements to discover the White Mountains.
That he was a useful citizen is evident from the provincial papers.
How many American Fields are descended from him cannot be determined,
but if there are any, there isn’t much doubt that they will
locate the birthplace of their ancestor in Ulster. This fad extends
even to some children of the modern Irish. The illustrious “Tim”
Campbell, ex-member of congress from New York, has been classified
as of “Scotch-Irish” descent, and recently a young man named
Quinn, of the first generation born here, said, “His father was a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>Scotch-Irishman from Kilkenny, in the north of Ireland.” A little
rough on the city paved with marble, but such is fad.</p>

<p class='c006'>A good, sturdy representative of the Fields to-day in New Hampshire,
as Irish in blood as Darby Field was, is the Hon. John H.
Field, who was a member of the state senate in 1899‒1900. His
home is Nashua. He is of the faith of his fathers.</p>

<p class='c006'>Darby Kelly was the ancestor of many American Kellys. His
descendants are almost innumerable. Like Darby Field, he, too,
was a soldier, as well as a schoolmaster and farmer. Gen. Benjamin
F. Kelly, of West Virginia, was his grandson; the latter acquired
distinction in the Civil War. The name Darby Kelly appears on the
muster rolls of company and regiment from 1748 to the fall of Wolfe
and Montcalm.</p>

<p class='c006'>Of the Patricks, Patrick O’Flynn possessed a military record his
offspring may well take pride in. His name appears quite often in
the short wars preceding the struggle for independence. He represented
the town of Bedford at Bunker Hill and served through the
long war which ended at Yorktown. At its close he went West, dying
in Illinois. His name appears on the United States pension rolls for
1825, with his company and regiment.</p>

<p class='c006'>Another was Patrick Cogan. He was quartermaster of the First
New Hampshire regiment, serving in that capacity under Stark,
Cilley and Reid. He died in the service in 1778. His regiment
was in Sullivan’s brigade at Ticonderoga in 1777. He represented
Sullivan’s town, Durham. Stephen Cogan, possibly a relative, was
a selectman in the same town in 1780, and with him were Joseph,
William and Joseph Cogan, Jr.</p>

<p class='c006'>A namesake, if not a relative of Darby Field, was Patrick Field,
a soldier in the Continental army. Patrick Guinlan was teaching
school in Concord before 1770. He is given mention in Bouton’s
history of that place.</p>

<p class='c006'>A well-known town in the south of Ireland is Dungarvan, and a
well-known locality in Concord is “Garvin’s Falls,” just south of the
city, on the Merrimack. The falls are named for Patrick Garvin,
one of the first settlers. His name appears frequently as one of the
defenders of the garrison against the Indians.</p>

<p class='c006'>New Hampshire furnished to Iowa one of her most distinguished
sons, in the person of the Hon. James W. Grimes, who acquired a
national reputation during the Civil War. One of the first, if not
the very first, of that name in New Hampshire was Patrick Grimes.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>Patrick Gault was the ancestor of some of New Hampshire’s substantial
citizens. His name appears early in the provincial papers.
As much can be said of Patrick Taggart and his descendants.</p>

<p class='c006'>Patrick White was the first of his line in the old Granite state.
He came to Peterborough before 1740. Gen. Daniel M. White,
commander of the New Hampshire National Guard in 1894, was one
of his descendants.</p>

<p class='c006'>Patrick Orr is a reminder of the slogan of 1798, “Remember
William Orr.” Many useful citizens of the Granite state bear this
name. It is not now so common as it was fifty or seventy-five years
ago. John Orr served seven terms in the state senate, his legislative
career ending in 1804.</p>

<p class='c006'>Patrick Griffin represented a name as common here now as it is in
Ireland. Simon G. Griffin, brevet major-general, was a New Hampshire
soldier with a fine record in the Civil War.</p>

<p class='c006'>Cornelius Connor represented a name famous in Ireland’s annals
and familiar to the readers of New Hampshire state and provincial
papers.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is first mentioned in 1710. The occasion was the payment of
a bill presented by him for moccasins, so it is fair to presume he
was a shoemaker. The name Connor, or Conner, has been well
known in the town of Exeter for nearly 200 years. An Exeter man,
possibly a descendant of Cornelius, was Col. Freeman Conner, who
commanded the Forty-fourth New York regiment in the Civil War.
He was also assistant postmaster of Chicago under the late James
A. Sexton, during the administration of President Benjamin Harrison.
J. M. Connor, of Hopkinton, is one of the prominent grangers
in New Hampshire, and an authority on agricultural matters.</p>

<p class='c006'>James O’Conner, a native of Ireland, and a surgeon in the Continental
army, was among the first settlers in the town of Sanbornton.
One of his descendants went to the East Indies and was traffic manager
of the Ganges canal in 1869. Cornelius Connor is the first of
the name to appear on the provincial records. The family has been
prolific—for the Connors are numerous—and is looked upon now as
a distinctive New Hampshire name.</p>

<p class='c006'>Another of the “Cons” was Cornelius Driscoll. His name
appears first in 1715, attached to a petition praying for the settlement
of a minister in Dover. The name is spelled Drisco, but there
is no question about it being Driscoll, for two reasons: first, the
given name Cornelius, as well as there also being a Teage Driscoll;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>“Tim” is the English of Teage; and second, the word Bristol is
spelled Bristo. The name is still spelled Drisco by people bearing
it. Later it appears spelled properly, “Driscoll,” in the state papers,
but an interrogation mark is placed after the name, which is evidence
of the mutilation of Irish names by those not conversant with their
character. Teage Drisco’s name appears on the records of the town
of Exeter in 1664, Cornelius Driscoe in 1725, and John Drisco in
1710. “Driscoll Hill,” in Francestown, is a locality spoken of in the
<cite>Granite Monthly</cite> for August, 1897. Cornelius Drisco was one of the
proprietors of the town of Gilmanton in 1727. Still another “Con,”
who appears often in the records, is Cornelius Lary. He was in
Exeter as early as 1674. Like other old Irish surnames, it was
twisted out of shape by the English scribes, so that in various places
it is spelled O’Leary, Lary, and Lear.</p>

<p class='c006'>As is well-known, this is one of the great south of Ireland names.
It would be of great interest to “Con’s” countrymen had he kept a
diary relating his experience in those days. “The Curse of Crummill”
was on the lips of many at that time, perhaps on his. Thirty-six
years later, in 1710, the names of Daniel, Samuel, Thomas, and
Cornelius Lary appear, perhaps the sons of the emigrant. It is still
common in Maine as well as in New Hampshire as Lary. Col.
Tobias Lear, of Portsmouth, was Washington’s secretary. Whether
his name was Leary originally, cannot be determined. He married
a daughter of Col. Pierse Long. The latter was the son of Pierse
Long who came to Portsmouth from Limerick, Ireland. Colonel
Long was with Sullivan at the capture of Newcastle, and commanded
a regiment in the Continental army.</p>

<p class='c006'>McDuffee has been a well-known New Hampshire family name for
one hundred and fifty years. Col. John McDuffee commanded a
regiment in the Continental army and some of the most substantial
business men in the state are of the same clan. The “Cons” were
also represented in this family in the person of Cornelius Duffee,
whose name appears in the index of the provincial papers.</p>

<p class='c006'>Of the Michaels, the most distinguished was Gen. Michael
McClary. He was the grandson of Andrew McClary, who came
over in 1726, to Epsom, and the nephew of Maj. Andrew McClary,
who fell at Bunker Hill, and of Lieut. John McClary, who was killed
in action at Saratoga. He was an ensign at Bunker Hill, and was
appointed captain in the Continental army later. He filled many
positions in civil life. He was the first adjutant-general of New
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>Hampshire under the new constitution, and also served as United
States marshal. The family was prominent in state affairs. John
McClary was a member of the governor’s council five years before
1785, and of the senate six years. Michael McClary served in the
senate twelve years, and James H. McClary, two years; Michael was
elected, but resigned, and James H. was chosen in convention to fill
the vacancy.</p>

<p class='c006'>The original emigrant, Andrew, came over on the same vessel with
James Harney. Their friendship was carried down to the third generation
in the name of James Harney McClary. There were others
of the same name in the state, but not of the same family. Whether
as Cleary, Clary, or Clery—with or without the Mac or the O—the
name is as Irish as the shamrock.</p>

<p class='c006'>Another of the Michaels who, if not as distinguished as the one
mentioned, was a useful citizen, was Michael Dwyer, who was one of
the first settlers of Holderness, N. H. His name appears frequently
in the state records; he was selectman of his town, and represented
it in the state legislature, and it is evident that he was prominent in
business and political affairs in his section of the state.</p>

<p class='c006'>A contemporary of his in Holderness was Capt. Bryan McSweeny,
a veteran of the old French, Indian, and Revolutionary wars.</p>

<p class='c006'>Others of the name of Dwyer were in New Hampshire before
Michael’s day, for the name of Edward Dwyer appears on the Exeter
town records in 1695, also that of James Dwyer. Time has probably
changed the name to Dyer.</p>

<p class='c006'>Michael Johnston was one of the first two settlers of Haverhill,
N. H., going there from Haverhill, Mass. His brother, Col. Charles
Johnston, in point of character, it is written, was the most prominent
of Haverhill’s first settlers. He also had a son Michael. Whether
Irish or Scottish, Johnston is the English for McShane or McIan.</p>

<p class='c006'>The name Carroll, borne by Maryland’s “first citizen,” was represented
among the New Hampshire Michaels, in the person of Michael
Carroll. A county also bears his name, and it is quite common in
New Hampshire. The New Hampshire national bank examiner is
the Hon. E. H. Carroll, and the labor commissioner is Col. L. H.
Carroll. A brother of the bank commissioner is superintendent of
schools in Worcester, Mass.</p>

<p class='c006'>Michael Annis, perhaps Ennis, bore the name of the man who
built the first house in the town of Warner. His father came from
Enniskillen “in Great Britain,” so the history reads, but Ireland
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>would be more correct geographically. Adding the Mac and spelling
the name properly it would be McGuinis, McInnis, McGinnis, McGuinness,
or Magenis.</p>

<p class='c006'>Michael Chatterton was the first of the Michaels to appear on the
New Hampshire records. He was one of the servants sent over by
Capt. John Mason, coming at the same time as Darby Field, between
1631 and 1640. With him was William Dermit. Albee, the historian
of Newcastle, wrote that Portsmouth’s first settlers were Celts from
Devon and Cornwall. There was more or less trade between the
colony in its early days and Limerick and Kilkenny, Ireland, Kilkenny
rugs and Limerick bacon being spoken of.</p>

<p class='c006'>Michael Clark represented another widely known New Hampshire
family name, well represented at the bar, on the bench, and in the
upper and lower branches of congress.</p>

<p class='c006'>Michael Fitzgerald was one of the great Norman Irish clan which
in time became more Irish than the Irish themselves. Edward Fitzgerald,
one of the first settlers of Boscawen, was reputed to be well
educated and prosperous. Col. John Fitzgerald was Washington’s
favorite aid.</p>

<p class='c006'>As a rule, the New Hampshire descendants of the Fitzgeralds
have divided the name. Some are known as Fitzes, others as
Geralds.</p>

<p class='c006'>Michael Kelly was a grandson of Darby Kelly mentioned, and the
brother of Gen. B. F. Kelly, of West Virginia, as well as the father
of ex-Mayor F. H. Kelly, of Worcester, and of Capt. Warren Michael
Kelly, of Donohoe’s Tenth N. H. regiment in the Civil War.</p>

<p class='c006'>Michael Lyons was a namesake of the impulsive Matthew Lyons,
of Vermont and Kentucky (who thanked God, when in congress, that
he was not one of “Cromwell’s bastards”), and also of Gen. Nathaniel
Lyons, one of the gallant soldiers and martyrs of the Civil War.</p>

<p class='c006'>Michael Metcalf bore the same surname as the only Knownothing
governor-elect of New Hampshire. The latter, maternally, was
sprung from a respectable Irish family named Montague, so the historian
of the town of Newport wrote, which perhaps accounts for the
appearance of Michael among the Metcalfs; and here was also a
Michael Metcalf, Jr., which showed that it took one generation to make
the name unpopular.</p>

<p class='c006'>Michael Smith bore a numerous family surname not confined to
any one of the British Isles, but common to all. He was in New
Hampshire early, and with him was Patrick Smith. No doubt both
were Irish.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>Michael Butler represented another great Irish family, whose most
distinguished member, produced in New Hampshire, was Gen.
Benjamin F. Butler. About the first to appear in the colony was
John Butler, who was in Dover in 1647. James Butler was in Woburn,
Mass., in or before 1676; his son, John Butler, came to Pelham,
N. H., in 1721. They are the ancestors of many of the name in
the state.</p>

<p class='c006'>The foregoing sketches have been written in order to show the
kind of men some of those New Hampshire Dennises, Corneliuses,
Patricks and Michaels were. A modern Irishman, bearing any of
these names, would never have his nationality questioned. All are
appended here so as to have them placed on record as another
piece of evidence to illustrate the presence of Irish in New Hampshire
before the Revolution.</p>

  <h2 id='MATTHEW' class='c004'>MATTHEW WATSON, AN IRISH SETTLER OF BARRINGTON, R. I., 1722.</h2>
</div>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div><span class='small'>BY THOMAS HAMILTON MURRAY.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>The town of Barrington is picturesquely located in eastern Rhode
Island. It has a fine outlook on Narragansett bay and also borders
on the Warren<a id='r43' /><a href='#f43' class='c016'><sup>[43]</sup></a> river. It was incorporated by Massachusetts in
1718. In 1746‒’47 the territory came under the jurisdiction of
Rhode Island, and Barrington was merged with Warren. In 1770
Warren was divided and Barrington again incorporated, this time
by Rhode Island. There are several historic sites in the town,
many pleasant drives and a number of interesting caves, woods and
districts. The present population is between 1600 and 1700.</p>

<p class='c006'>One of the earliest Irish settlers in Barrington<a id='r44' /><a href='#f44' class='c016'><sup>[44]</sup></a> was Matthew
Watson. He located there<a id='r45' /><a href='#f45' class='c016'><sup>[45]</sup></a> over 175 years ago and reminiscences
of his life and times are still current among the people. Matthew
was born in Ireland in 1696. His people are believed to have been
Presbyterians, an element that has given many sturdy patriots to
the cause of Irish nationality.<a id='r46' /><a href='#f46' class='c016'><sup>[46]</sup></a> The family left Ireland for America
about 1712. They landed in Boston.</p>

<p class='c006'>What induced them to leave the old country can only be conjectured.
It is reasonable to suppose, however, that it was due to
causes that compelled thousands of other Irish Presbyterians to
emigrate. These causes were the result of English oppression. The
Irish Presbyterians were treated with great harshness<a id='r47' /><a href='#f47' class='c016'><sup>[47]</sup></a> by various
successive governments in England. At one time edicts of banishment
were issued against their ministers; at another we find the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>government wickedly declaring their pulpits vacant and filling them
with clergymen of the Established church. When England had a
policy of church or state to carry out in Ireland it could be made to
bear heavily on the Presbyterian as on the Catholic. England’s
repeated suppression of Irish industries also caused great numbers
of Presbyterians and Irish Protestants, generally, to emigrate to
America.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Watson family here mentioned consisted of Matthew, his
father and mother, four brothers and one sister. Sometime after
arriving in Boston the family removed to Leicester, Mass. Matthew
came to Barrington in 1722, being then in his 26th year. He
entered the employ of John Read, a brickmaker, and rapidly attained
great proficiency in the business, winning the confidence of his
employer and the esteem of his associates. In the course of time
he fell in love with his employer’s daughter, Bethiah. His affection
was reciprocated and the two soon became engaged. The
fact becoming known, Bethiah’s father earnestly opposed it. She
was his only daughter, and he eloquently represented to her the
“folly” of throwing herself away on “a little poor Irishman.”
His arguments were of no avail, however, and she and Matthew
were married at Barrington in 1732.</p>

<p class='c006'>It was a happy marriage and her father lived to bless the day
when the “little poor Irishman” became his daughter’s husband.
Subsequently Matthew purchased the farm of his father-in-law and
conducted the brick-making business on an extensive scale. He
erected a commodious brick mansion house which became known to
the country round about as the “Great Watson Mansion,” embellished
the grounds and amassed a fortune of $80,000.<a id='r48' /><a href='#f48' class='c016'><sup>[48]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>By some it is held that Matthew’s father had also located in Barrington.
The original Watson property comprised a very large part
of the town. The homestead has since been greatly reduced,
however, by dividing it among the children, by bequests and by
extensive sales to new-comers. The estate at present comprises
about fifty acres, tillable and woodland, held by descendants of
Matthew. The land is very productive. There is one six-acre lot,
nearly as level as a floor, and which produces rich crops of hay,
although it has not been dressed in the past thirty years.<a id='r49' /><a href='#f49' class='c016'><sup>[49]</sup></a> Underneath
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>the greater part of the estate is a stratum of the best quality of
blue clay within four to six feet of the surface.</p>

<p class='c006'>This stratum underlies nearly the entire town, cropping out on the
bay and river shores. The principal industry of Barrington is
brick-making, which has been carried on for an indefinite period.
At present 30,000,000 are produced annually. The labor in the old
brick-yards of the Watson family was done chiefly by slaves of
whom Watson owned nearly fifty. All these he manumitted some
time before his death. The continuous transportation of brick to the
bay, by these slaves, for shipment gradually wore a roadway more
than six feet in depth.<a id='r50' /><a href='#f50' class='c016'><sup>[50]</sup></a> By plowing and cultivation this has long
since been mostly filled in, though there are still places where the
old roadway shows two or three feet deep. Some time in the
eighteenth century a law was passed ordaining that bricks should
be made of certain specified dimensions. Matthew Watson, the
settler, considered this requirement as very unjust, and so decided
not to change the size of his product. In order to escape prosecution,
however, he ceased calling his goods brick, but instead styled
them “Watson’s ware.” As there was no law regarding “Watson’s
ware” the plan succeeded, and the old gentleman continued making
and selling brick at their former dimensions.<a id='r51' /><a href='#f51' class='c016'><sup>[51]</sup></a> The “Great Watson
Mansion” was for a long period visited by people who had heard
of its dimensions and sumptuous furnishings and who desired to
feast their eyes upon so much grandeur.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is said to have possessed some of the earliest wall paper used
in America, outside of Boston. The jambs, mantels and hearth
were constructed of marble and imported from Amsterdam. The
carpet was made from the wool of sheep raised on the farm, and
being the first carpet used in those parts attracted visitors from
points even forty miles away. A part of the mansion was recently still
standing, and occupied by descendants of Matthew. The present is
the sixth American generation of the family. Matthew, born in 1696,
died in 1807; having completed 110 years of life and started on his
111th.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is said that up to the day of his death, his faculties were unimpaired,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>except for blindness. On the day that he was 100 years old
he called for his saddle-horse, mounted without assistance and rode
off briskly for a couple of miles. Upon his return, the negro servant
being absent, and the great gate unopened, he touched up his horse
and cleared it at a bound.</p>

<p class='c006'>Further interesting facts regarding Matthew Watson are found
in an article published<a id='r52' /><a href='#f52' class='c016'><sup>[52]</sup></a> some years before his death. It was written
at Barrington and reads as follows:</p>

<p class='c006'>“There is now living in this town Matthew Watson, Esq., in the
105th year of his age, in a pretty good state of health, and in the
enjoyment of his faculties, except being blind. He was born in Coleraine
in the province of Ulster, in the north of Ireland, in March, <span class='fss'>A. D.</span>
1696, from whence he, with his father and mother, four brothers and
one sister, migrated and arrived at Boston, <span class='fss'>A. D.</span> 1712, from whence
they removed to and settled in Leicester, in the county of Worcester
(Mass.), where he hath one brother, Deacon Oliver Watson, now
living. Mr. Watson came to this town <span class='fss'>A. D.</span> 1722, where by his
industry he acquired a pretty handsome fortune. He hath sustained
the office of a Justice of the Peace in the town, and was
formerly a Judge of the Court of Common Pleas for the county of
Bristol. He hath been a member of the Congregational church in
this town between seventy and eighty years without censure. He
hath ten children now living, the youngest of whom is fifty-three
years of age, all in a married state, except his eldest and youngest
daughters, who are widows. He was born in the seventeenth, lived
through the eighteenth and is now progressing in the nineteenth
century.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The foregoing extract was found, in 1893, by the writer while
engaged in examining files of the <cite>Providence Gazette</cite> at the rooms of
the Rhode Island Historical Society in Providence. As the article
was written at Barrington during the lifetime of the centenarian,
some, at least, of the facts were probably obtained from his own lips.
The extract may therefore be considered as authoritatively settling
certain data which have long been in dispute.</p>

<hr class='c023' />

<p class='c006'>Matthew is said to have had fifteen children, ten of whom were
living at the time of his decease.<a id='r53' /><a href='#f53' class='c016'><sup>[53]</sup></a> The names of these ten were
Abigail, Mary, Rachel, Mercy, Bethiah, Matthew, Lydia, William,
John and Samuel. There were also many grandchildren and great
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>grandchildren. In Arnold’s “Vital Record of Rhode Island” appears
an entry under Barrington which states in substance that “Robert
Watson and Mary Orr married at Londonderry, Ireland, 1695.”
They were probably the parents of Matthew, the Barrington settler,
who had the names recorded for purpose of reference; or they may
have been so recorded by some other member of the family. The
centenarian was twice married.<a id='r54' /><a href='#f54' class='c016'><sup>[54]</sup></a> Bethia, his first wife, died in 1778,
leaving ten children. One of Matthew’s descendants, John Watson,
married Ann Waterman, daughter of Capt. Asa Waterman,
of Rhode Island, who was assistant commissary-general during the
Revolution. She was related to Governor Cooke of Rhode Island.</p>

<p class='c006'>Among the centenarian’s descendants were the following: Robert
S. W. Watson who wedded Patience Blygh. He was born in 1804;
Annie Cooke Watson, born in 1831; Dr. S. T. Watson, born 1832;
John W. Watson, 1835; Mary H. Watson, 1837; Henry H. Watson,
1839; Robert S. Watson, 1843; Emily F. Watson, 1845; Robert S.
Watson, 1846; Charlotte A. Watson, 1850.</p>

<p class='c006'>Nearly every generation of the family has had a Matthew in it. A
second Matthew Watson was born in 1741.<a id='r55' /><a href='#f55' class='c016'><sup>[55]</sup></a> A Matthew Watson of
a later generation married Abby B. Wheaton, of Providence, in 1818.
The Providence Directory for 1844 shows “Matthew Watson, manufacturer,
rear Roger Williams Bank,” and gives his residence as
Angell street. In February, 1892, the following interesting communication
appeared in the Providence <cite>Journal</cite>. Its author is thought
to have been Matthew Watson, of Providence, a recent representative
of the name.</p>

<hr class='c023' />

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>The Cup That Cheers.</span> To the Editor of the <cite>Journal</cite>: The
first time that tea was brought to Barrington, Rhode Island, is not
known to the writer of this article, but the second time it was
brought by Matthew Watson something over a hundred and fifty
years ago, before the famous Boston tea party.</p>

<p class='c006'>Matthew Watson sold brick which he manufactured from the clay
on his own property, which was extensive, even for those days, in
Newport. On one of his trips there he bought the teapot, a sketch
of which appears with this article, and six teacups.</p>

<p class='c006'>As tea had never been used, of course there was no tea-kettle, and
water to make this was boiled in a dinner pot hanging from a crane
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>over the wood fire. The teapot now is in possession of one of
Matthew Watson’s descendants, and is a quaint little affair of some
ancient style of crockery. It stands on three legs, which adds to
its unique appearance.</p>

<p class='c006'>Once it was broken into eight pieces, but was so cleverly mended
that it is almost impossible to detect this as it stands, with other
heirlooms, looking down on the china and glass of later dates.</p>

<p class='c005'>The history of a country is dear to the heart of the lover of that
country. By the aid of historical study we learn of the origin,
growth and development of a race of people; their customs, religions,
laws, governments; their accomplishments and what they have
contributed to the economy of the world.</p>

<p class='c006'>The historian points out the past to the present and future. He
puts aside the veil that has gathered about the dim past, opens up
to the gaze of the bright present the panorama of human achievement,
and blazes the way for his successor in the rosy future.</p>

<p class='c006'>What the clergyman learns from the theological disputations of
the past, the poring monk has gathered together; what the physician
now acquires with comparative ease is furnished him by the
knowledge garnered from the experience of his brethren from the
time when man learned that pain and aches affected his being;
what the lawyer gains from precedents is a guiding light which
sheds its rays upon problems of jurisprudence that the legal lore of
the past generations has taken from the leaves of experience;
what formulæ the scientist is able to demonstrate, he owes to the
observations of men who, through the ages, have chronicled the
phenomena of nature; the statesman is able to meet the crisis of
the present by being informed as to other crises in governmental
affairs.</p>

<p class='c006'>The citizen of a republic who neglects to learn the fundamental
principles upon which rest the laws of the land; who does not
know how the country was developed and maintained is as a blind
man and not able to bring to the exercise of his suffrage the amount
of intelligence that the country has a right to require from him.</p>

<p class='c006'>This obligation comes to us in a twofold capacity. We, as citizens
of this great republic, should study the history of our country
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>from a patriotic standpoint, while as Irishmen, or descendants of
Irishmen, it should be not only a duty, but a pleasure, to learn of
the deeds of the Irish in America.</p>

<p class='c006'>Therefore, an organization such as the American-Irish Historical
Society, if it had no other <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">raison d’être</span></i>, would accomplish a patriotic
purpose if it served only as an incentive to the study of the
deeds of Irishmen and their descendants in America. It has
become almost a maxim in historical matters, that the history of
events cannot be accepted as facts until the generation which
lived at the time said events occurred has passed away.</p>

<p class='c006'>The passions, influences and conditions which generate, shape
and control events, lend a coloring to their recital, which deep-hued
or faint as painted by the writer at the time, are toned down or
made stronger by the historian of a future generation, who, unmindful
of passions, influences or conditions, and with an eye single to
the preservation of history by means of the truth, makes past occurrences
stand out in their true light.</p>

<p class='c006'>Deeds that have received but a passing mention from writers whose
minds were biased, are rescued from an unmerited insignificance,
and placed high in the Temple of Fame; while highly extolled
acts, given undue prominence by a partisan writer, are consigned to
a merited oblivion by the historian of a later but more impartial
epoch.</p>

<p class='c006'>A member of the Society of Friends who desires to familiarize
himself with the history of his sect in New England, would find
but little of the truth in the writings which have come from such
intellectual dyspeptics as Cotton Mather and his disciples. But, in
the unwritten history of Quaker persecutions that have become
legendary, by the purity of their lives, by their nobility of character
and their Christianizing influences, the pioneers of that faith
stand out in bold relief in the religious history of Puritan New
England, with its dark background of scourging, mutilation, banishments
and hangings.</p>

<p class='c006'>By analogy, how can the Irish-American race expect that the
history of Irishmen in New England can be presented in just
proportion to the true merits of the case? As in New England,
so throughout the colonies. The Virginia Cavalier was not less
hostile to the Irish than the Massachusetts Puritan.</p>

<p class='c006'>Should the American-Irish Historical Society go out of existence
to-morrow, it would have already accomplished a grand mission in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>this: that it has brought forth from obscure records the deeds of
Irishmen in America, and has laid the foundation for the erection of
an historical monument to Irishmen, that, with its base laid in colonial
times, and still being constructed, challenges the respect and
admiration of all lovers of American history.</p>

<p class='c006'>The work of this society has been thus far largely confined to
research of New England records. This research has been fruitful
of good results. Among other things we learn of the Irish as brickmakers
at Rehobeth, Mass., and as settlers in Salem and Lynn in
early colonial times.</p>

<p class='c006'>Again, we learn that the Irish in the Granite state had become so
numerous in colonial times that the general court of Massachusetts
passed a law prohibiting the “wild Irishmen of New Hampshire”
from coming across the state line, lest they should drive out the
people of the older colony. As long as that state shall last the glory
and the fame of the Sullivans and their contemporaries of the Irish
race will remain illustrious.</p>

<p class='c006'>This research has extracted from the records of Rhode Island the
influence of the Irish schoolmaster, MacSparran, in moulding the
intellectual development of that colony; it has called attention to
the work of George Berkeley in the promotion of education here, and
what is to me personally exceedingly pleasant information, that
Brown University, my beloved alma mater, in its infancy was succored
by the contributions of worthy people residing in Ireland.</p>

<p class='c006'>The work of presenting to the world the achievements of the Irish
in America, in its just proportion to the achievements of men of
other races in the colonization, struggle for independence, and the
creation of a republic, the development of that republic from a theory
into a concrete nation, and the perpetuation of that nation, is a duty
not only to the men whose deeds are to be chronicled, but also a debt
which we owe to ourselves, which we should cheerfully assume. The
labor involved in this from its very nature is such as can only be
performed by an organization such as the American-Irish Historical
Society.</p>

<p class='c006'>The true status of the Irish in America, notwithstanding the fact
that their brain and brawn have been interwoven in the woof and
web of our nation’s fabric, has never been fully appreciated by reason
of the prejudices which have been associated with anything that bore
an Irish name. This prejudice, in no small part, arose from misconception
and misunderstanding of the Irish nature, temperament, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>characteristics. There is a brand of bigotry that is sometimes
designated as inborn. In the case of a bigot whose bigotry is congenital,
it is well to follow the Scriptural injunction to reason not
with a fool lest he grow wise.</p>

<p class='c006'>But in the case of those persons who, by reason of misconception,
or want of acquaintance with Irishmen, cannot properly estimate our
race, yet whose minds are broad enough to cherish the worth of a
man when demonstrated, and whose patriotism counts every man a
friend who has contributed to the glory of his country, an impartial
history of the deeds of Irishmen in America would effectively serve
to displace any prejudice.</p>

<p class='c006'>What lover of the human race, animated by that noble sentiment
of Terrence, “I am a man, and I think nothing human foreign to
me,” can fail to appreciate the sturdy virtues of the Irish people in
America, their patient industry, their obedience to constituted
authority, their domestic constancy, their desire to provide homes for
their families, and education for their children.</p>

<p class='c006'>What patriotic American can fail to be moved by emotions of
gratitude when he learns among other facts that the Irish in Ireland
assisted with food and provisions the struggling settlers of Boston
in a time of dire distress; that Irishmen of Philadelphia contributed
large sums of money to the famished Revolutionary heroes at Valley
Forge; that George Washington considered himself honored in
being elected a member of an Irish society; that nine of the signers
of the Declaration of Independence were men of Irish blood; that
on the field of war, and in the council chamber of the nation, as well
as in the administration of national, state, and municipal affairs, from
the time of our earliest history to the present time, men of that race
have given their lives and property to the nation’s cause. The work
of this society thus far in this direction gives promise of either
destroying the prejudices that have hitherto existed against the Irish
people, or removing the venom from the fangs of bigotry.</p>

<p class='c006'>To my mind the most urgent need of a society of this nature is
the means it affords of preserving Irish history in America. It
would be a great misfortune if the history of the Irish people in
America, at present fragmentary at best, yet gathered together under
favorable conditions and after the most careful and painstaking
labor, could not find some secure lodgment.</p>

<p class='c006'>What more suitable abiding place than the cabinet of the American-Irish
Historical Society, from whence it could find its way into the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>private and public libraries, not only of our own country, but of the
civilized world?</p>

<p class='c006'>This Society, in the short time it has been in existence, has accomplished
so much in its chosen field as already to have demonstrated
quite clearly its scope. From the publications issued by its members,
notably the work of Secretary-General Murray in Massachusetts
and Rhode Island, Commissioner Linehan in New Hampshire,
Senator Walsh in Georgia, Hon. Joseph T. Lawless in Virginia, and
others, our Society has already contributed a fund of rich historical
value to the history of this country. It would suffice to cite this
labor to show the scope.</p>

<p class='c006'>The thought has occurred to me that it might be well, however, to
suggest a specialization of this work, and to provide avenues for its
dissemination. The Society should pursue the line of procedure
already mapped out by extending its membership to every state in
the country. Membership should be selected from men of scholarly
attainments, devoted to historical research. This membership should
be so catholic as to include men of all religious denominations and
nationalities.</p>

<p class='c006'>Apropos of this, I beg leave to call attention to the great work
done and being done by German scholars in the study of Celtic, to
illustrate the probable value of assistance that might be rendered
to us by men of other nationalities. The Society should coöperate
with the movements in the other states looking to the establishment
of record commissions, and in states where such movements have
not been set on foot, to labor to create such movements.</p>

<p class='c006'>With such an inviting field of labor spread out before us, this
Society not only supplies a long-felt want, but also a means of inspiration.
Each member can contribute to the common fund of historical
data, and the sum total of these contributions will go to make
up a work of great value.</p>

<p class='c006'>The need of such an organization as the American-Irish Historical
Society being demonstrated, and its scope clearly defined, all
that remains to be done to perpetuate its success is to continue in
the work already so auspiciously undertaken.</p>

  <h2 id='THE5' class='c004'>THE UNITED STATES TORPEDO-BOAT O’BRIEN.</h2>
</div>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div><span class='small'>COMPILED FROM THE DAILY PAPERS.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>The torpedo-boat <i>O’Brien</i>,<a id='r57' /><a href='#f57' class='c016'><sup>[57]</sup></a> for the United States navy, was
launched at Lewis Nixon’s “Crescent shipyard,” Elizabethport,
N. J., Sept. 24, 1900. She is named the <i>O’Brien</i>, to perpetuate
the memory of the five O’Brien brothers,—Jeremiah, Gideon, William,
John, and Joseph,—sons of Maurice O’Brien of Cork, Ireland,
who had settled at Machias, Me. The boys are believed to have
all been born in the latter place.</p>

<p class='c006'>After the news of the battle of Lexington reached Machias, the
townspeople erected a liberty pole, and the fact having been communicated
to the British authorities, the sloop-of-war <i>Margaretta</i>,
under the command of Lieutenant Moore of the English navy, was
directed to proceed from Boston to Machias to investigate the
matter.</p>

<p class='c006'>The <i>Margaretta</i> went, and was captured by the O’Briens, after a
sharp fight, May 11, 1775. Lieutenant Moore’s sword was presented
to Joseph O’Brien, he being the “baby” of the expedition.
It has been handed down from father to son ever since. The sword
was exhibited at the launching and attracted no little attention.</p>

<p class='c006'>The young lady who “christened” the <i>O’Brien</i>, Miss Myra Lincoln
O’Brien, is a descendant of Joseph O’Brien, the “baby” above
mentioned. Her father, Albert H. O’Brien, is a lawyer in Philadelphia.
He served in the Civil War, and subsequently in the United
States marines, from which corps he resigned as a first lieutenant in
1875. Her grandfather was Dennis W. O’Brien of Philadelphia,
who died in 1878, while filling the office of judge of the Orphans’
court of Philadelphia county, and her great-grandfather was Dennis
O’Brien, a merchant of Reading, Pa.</p>

<p class='c006'>The day was a pleasant one for the launching, and despite the
early hour set for the ceremony, Miss O’Brien, several of her relatives
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>and friends, Lewis Nixon, Superintendent Ackerman, and the
heads of the various departments were on hand. When the christening
party were placed on the vessel the workmen released the huge
hull and the <i>O’Brien</i> gracefully slid from the ways. The launching
of the <i>O’Brien</i> marks another step in the consummation of the government
plan of perpetuating the names of the more prominent
figures in the American Revolution. The O’Briens were a family
who possessed indomitable courage and spirit and played a conspicuous
part in this country’s battle for freedom.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is stated that on the arrival of the <i>Margaretta</i> off Machias, her
commanding officer, Lieutenant Moore, notified the town officials
that the Liberty pole must come down or the vessel would open fire
on the town.</p>

<p class='c006'>On Sunday morning, May 11, a lumber sloop commanded by Jeremiah
O’Brien, with about fifty men armed with muskets and
pitchforks, left the town and sailed down the bay in the direction of
the <i>Margaretta</i>. There was a hand-to-hand fight on the decks, and
though the English fought well with their small arms, the <i>Margaretta</i>
was a prize within twenty minutes. Lieutenant Moore and ten of
his men were killed and others severely wounded, the attacking party
losing six men killed, while five were wounded.</p>

<p class='c006'>This capture was the first naval engagement of the American Revolution,<a id='r58' /><a href='#f58' class='c016'><sup>[58]</sup></a>
but Jeremiah O’Brien and his brothers, William and John,
subsequently received provincial commissions and participated in
other engagements as commanding officers.</p>

<p class='c006'>The <i>O’Brien</i> is a magnificent boat and looks the fighter, every inch
of her. She is 175 feet long on her water line, 17 feet beam, and of
14 feet, 6 inches draught. Her displacement is about 165 tons. Steel
has been used whenever possible, and when wood has been used it
has been electrically treated so as to be fireproof. In every part unnecessary
weight has been eliminated. The piston rods, shafts,
connecting rods and working parts generally are of nickel steel.</p>

<p class='c006'>There are four cylinder, triple expansion engines, one high power
cylinder, 18 inches in diameter, one intermediate power cylinder, 27
inches in diameter, and two low power cylinders, 27½ inches in
diameter, each with an 18‒inch stroke. The indicated horse power is
3,500, which will give 350 revolutions to the screws per minute.
There are twin screws instead of a single screw. The propelling
engines are located in a water-tight compartment.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>On board, there is every appliance known to modern naval engineering.
The two condensers each have a cooling surface of 1,500
feet. A distilling plant for distilling salt water into fresh water is also
supplied in the boat, as well as an air compressing and an electric
lighting plant. Three boilers of the Mosher water-tube design give
the needed power. They are powerfully constructed and will give a
working pressure of 250 pounds to the square inch, with a heating
surface of 8,325 square feet. Each boiler is to be supplied with a
smoke-pipe standing about ten feet above the deck.</p>

<p class='c006'>The <i>O’Brien</i> is low in the water and exceedingly hard to locate at
night, even by the use of searchlights. She is a type of the advanced
fighting machine, and her entire appearance denotes the
fighter. Her armament is as follows: Three torpedo tubes, two
forward, one aft, and three three-pound rapid-fire guns, located as
are the torpedo tubes. When in commission she will carry a Whitehead
torpedo in each tube, and additional ones on the racks near
the tubes. The boat will carry sixty officers and men.</p>

<hr class='c023' />

<p class='c006'>Speaking of the capture of the <i>Margaretta</i>, Capt. Edward
O’Meagher Condon, a member of the American-Irish Historical
Society, says in his excellent work:<a id='r59' /><a href='#f59' class='c016'><sup>[59]</sup></a> “This was the <i>first naval
fight</i> of the Revolution, and Jeremiah O’Brien was the victorious
commander. Two British cruisers, the <i>Diligence</i> and <i>Tapnaguish</i>,
were at once despatched to lay Machias in ashes, but they also were
met and captured by O’Brien, his brothers and comrades. The
young hero immediately sailed, with his prizes and prisoners, for
Watertown, Mass., where the Provincial Congress was in session,
and received the thanks of that body and a captain’s commission.
But the British were not yet satisfied. They sent from Halifax a
squadron, including a frigate, a twenty-gun corvette, a brig of sixteen
guns, and several armed schooners, to crush the weak American
fleet; but O’Brien, aided by Colonel Foster, was once more triumphant,
and beat them off after a hard struggle.</p>

<p class='c006'>“They then sent a strong body of land forces against Machias,
but after the second day’s march from Passamaquoddy the British
troops returned to Halifax, despairing of effecting a passage through
the woods, or, perhaps, hopeless of accomplishing their purpose when
confronted by those who had already conquered their fellow-mercenaries
three times at sea. We are told that Maurice O’Brien,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>old as he was, could hardly be restrained from joining his gallant
sons in their daring enterprise against the British.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Three of the O’Briens, Jeremiah, John and William, continued
in the naval service of the republic until the close of the war. Jeremiah
was appointed to the command of <i>The Liberty</i>, and his brother
William served under him as lieutenant. ‘For two years this vessel
and another did good service on the northern coast, affording
protection to American navigation, after which they were laid up.’
Jeremiah, with others, then fitted out a twenty-gun letter-of-marque,
called the <i>Hannibal</i>, manned by one hundred and thirty men.</p>

<p class='c006'>“She took several prizes; but at length falling in with two British
frigates, she was overhauled after a chase of forty-eight hours and
captured. O’Brien was first confined in the <i>Jersey</i> prison-ship,
otherwise known as the <i>Hell</i>, at the Wallabout, where the Brooklyn
navy yard now is. At the end of about six months he was sent to
Mill prison, England, whence he succeeded in effecting his escape
about a year later. He retired after the war to Brunswick, Me.,
where, at the age of over fourscore, he furnished the details of his
brave achievements to a generation which had shamefully forgotten
him and them.</p>

<p class='c006'>“John O’Brien was more fortunate than his gallant brother.
From a journal kept by him the following extracts are taken: On
June 9, 1779, he sailed in the armed schooner <i>Hibernia</i>. On June
21, he took an English brig and sent her in. On June 25, he had
an engagement with a ship of seventeen guns, from three till five
o’clock p. m., when a frigate came up and the <i>Hibernia</i> was compelled
to leave her anticipated prize and was pursued by the frigate till
midnight. O’Brien had three men killed and several wounded in this
fight. On July 7 he took a schooner, and sent her to Newburyport.
On the day following, in company with Captain Leach of Salem, he
took a ship carrying thirteen four-pounders; a few hours after, a brig;
and then a schooner laden with molasses. On July 11, he took a
brig in ballast, and then chased and captured another. He adds
that if he and Captain Leach had not parted in a fog they could have
taken the whole fleet. Capt. John O’Brien was never captured by
the enemy. No trace is found after the capture of the <i>Hannibal</i>, of
Lieut. William O’Brien. He was most probably among the 11,000
victims of British cruelty, whose corpses were buried, or flung on the
shores of the Wallabout.”</p>

  <h2 id='THE6' class='c004'>THE SOCIETY’S FIELD IN CALIFORNIA.</h2>
</div>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div><span class='small'>BY JAMES CONNOLLY, CORONADO, CAL.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>The American-Irish Historical Society is national, broad and
comprehensive. To those familiar with the way in which our race
has been misrepresented or omitted in some histories of California,
nothing more is needed than the mere fact of the existence of such a
society as ours as an inducement to their taking an interest in it.
But there are the great majorities on the other hand who have little
time to look into such matters in out of the way places, before whom
I wish to place the more important purposes and scope of the Society.</p>

<p class='c006'>Probably no great incentive to the study of the latter phases of
this Society is needed than the fact that during its short existence it
has been extended to over thirty states of the Union and to the District
of Columbia. Most or all of the men who first conceived the
need and then issued the call for its organization are of national
reputation in the several walks of life. The first meeting was held
at the Revere House, Boston, Jan. 20, 1897. Rear Admiral Richard
Worsam Meade was then elected the first president-general. With
seven generations of American ancestry back of him, and brother of
the hero of Gettysburg, it would have been hard to find a more representative
man of the race for that office than he.</p>

<p class='c006'>In thus honoring him the Society was doubly honoring itself. The
race that gave the new United States navy Commodore Jack Barry,
might as well supply a rear admiral for president of this Society in
1897. The strides forward during the intervening century have
been certainly great. And to-day the race stands as firmly and fearlessly
as it did then, for freedom. Theodore Roosevelt, governor of
the Empire state, who is so distinguished in literature, war and
statecraft that it would be hard to tell in which he most excels, is
among the members.</p>

<p class='c006'>The mere mention of these names that have come so conspicuously
before the world is not calculated to signify that there are not
many others of almost or quite equal note. Scholars, statesmen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>and soldiers are numerous among the Society’s officers and members.
But in such a brotherhood as ours there are no caste barriers.
In the common endeavor for the common good of seeing that American
history is truly written, we meet and act upon common ground.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Fidelity, truth, honor, are the watchwords,” says the preamble to
the constitution, “and under their noble influence should our work
be done.” Of the nine distinct objects and purposes set forth in
Article II of the constitution, two may be quoted as embodying the
more essential features of our work:</p>

<p class='c006'>“(2) To investigate specially the immigration of the people of Ireland
to this country, determine its numbers, examine the sources,
learn the places of its settlement, and estimate its influence on contemporary
events in war, legislation, religion, education and other
departments of human activity.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“(7) To promote by union in a common high purpose a sincere
fraternity, a greater emulation in well doing, a closer confidence and
mutual respect among the various elements of the Irish race in
America, that, by putting behind them the asperities of the past,
they may unite in a common brotherhood with their fellow-citizens
for the honor of the race and the glory of the Republic.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Nor are the seven other articles of any less importance, that of
the fourth pertaining to the correction of “erroneous, distorted and
false views of history,” and the substitution of truth based upon documentary
evidence, therefor, being amongst the most essential work
to be done. Had we only to deal with our national history, voluminous
as it is, the work before us would seem quite easy.</p>

<p class='c006'>But there are the almost innumerable state, county, city and town
histories, each of which needs as thorough sifting as does the national.
This fact was indelibly impressed upon my mind three years ago
when I was wading through California state and city histories for
kernels of truth pertaining to “The Precursors of the Pioneers,” and
other matter which I was then writing for publication. Never was
the need more palpably illustrated of keeping well informed on the
substance of all these histories than by a combination of self-constituted
“protectors” of everything American, when they confronted
us with accusations of disloyalty to the Republic and openly sought
to insult us with taunts of being “the Pope’s Irish.” But brief as
has been the interval, time has already doubly vindicated us. When
there were Spanish guns to be faced our accusers stayed bravely at
home.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>There are no sectarian or religious differences in our Society.
Priests and ministers here unite in bands of blood and brotherhood.
We now mourn the quite recent death of Rev. George W. Pepper,
a Methodist minister of Ohio, one of our ablest workers. Very Rev.
Andrew Morrissey, president of the Catholic University of Notre
Dame, is also in our ranks.</p>

<p class='c006'>I heartily wish that the duty of endeavoring to enlist the interest
of men of Irish blood in California in the organization of a State
Chapter of this Society devolved upon some of the many abler and
better equipped men in the state. But even the keenest sense of
one’s own shortcomings will not justify the shirking of such a duty.
Here on the fag end of things [Coronado] we are few in numbers.
In the hot press of the main chance there seem to be few having
time or interest enough to spare to such a brotherhood. But I am
quite sure that in the larger cities of San Francisco, Sacramento,
Stockton and Los Angeles, there are many patriotic, true men and
well-wishers of our race who will cheerfully join us in organizing a
State Chapter, and to these I now appeal for coöperation to that
end.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Any person of good moral character, who is interested in the
special work of the society, shall be deemed eligible to membership
in the same. No tests other than that of character and devotion to
the Society’s objects shall be applied to membership.” The only
charge is an annual due of three dollars. Persons wishing to become
members may send me their names with addresses and I will
send them blanks of application for membership. These they will
fill out and send to me and I will forward them to the Secretary-General,
or they may write directly to him, addressing Thomas Hamilton
Murray, Woonsocket, R. I.</p>

<p class='c006'>The application must be accompanied by the annual fee. A
handsome and comprehensive volume of the Society’s work is issued
each year. The annual meeting and banquet was held in New York
this year, and was a splendid affair. Let us have a California Chapter
of this Society that will be a fit representative of our state and
race.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>
  <h2 id='THE7' class='c004'>THE HISTORICAL PLACE OF IRISHMEN IN CALIFORNIA.</h2>
</div>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div><span class='small'>A CIRCULAR ISSUED BY THE KNIGHTS OF ST. PATRICK, SAN FRANCISCO.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>The Knights of St. Patrick of San Francisco, an organization of
gentlemen of Irish birth or descent, has recently affiliated with the
American-Irish Historical Society, whose purpose is the investigation,
recording and presentation in appropriate literary form of the
influence of the Irish element in the upbuilding of the Republic.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Knights undertake, as their special share of a large and commendable
work, an investigation of the historical place of the Irishman
in California.</p>

<p class='c006'>Each of the races claiming to form part of the primal stock of the
Republic has its own historical association and has traced the movements
of its own blood by special historical investigation. We have
the story of the English, the Dutch, the Huguenot, the Spaniard.
The story of one of the largest fractions of the parent people of the
Republic, the Irish, is being written.</p>

<p class='c006'>These special researches are admittedly of the highest value to
general history. They can be prosecuted with the greatest success
by particular work in each state. To this end, the Knights of St.
Patrick desire to initiate a thorough, solid, sober investigation of the
Irishman’s part in the life of California. Not to satisfy a prejudice
or mere pride of race, but laboring for right and truth to impartially
set forth the facts of its racial life, that they may “supply omissions,
correct errors, allay passions and shame prejudice.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The pioneers of this state, the men who made history, are rapidly
disappearing. With them go the original sources of the most valuable
information. If the work above described be not undertaken
now, our posterity will face the same difficulties that confront our
Eastern brethren in their present search for authentic information.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Society, therefore, desires to begin its investigations at once
and to extend them to every part of the community, placing them
under the conduct of names that, assuring painstaking research and
impartial and discriminating judgment, will certainly present the results
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>of their labor in attractive literary form; so that the work, commanding
the respect and attention of the community, may have a
definite and permanent historical value.</p>

<p class='c006'>The work of investigation is to be influenced neither by political
nor religious divisions. The race is paramount. Whether it came
from this part of Ireland or that; whether it worshiped at this shrine
or that, is but a qualifying incident. We seek the life and labors of
the race; to record its arrival, its participation in the civil, political,
and military activities of the state, “to try truthfully and fearlessly
to record its achievements.”</p>

<p class='c006'>To this end, we invite and request your coöperation in procuring
facts bearing upon our subject. You may possess original information
or know from whom or where it may be obtained, the location
or character of relics that would be of interest or value. You
may be able to suggest a line of inquiry that would aid our purpose.
Historical information flows from a thousand sources. A reminiscence,
a relic, an old newspaper clipping, a letter, a bit of unwritten
biography, may be a clew to important evidence or the prolific
source of many unsuspected facts.</p>

<p class='c006'>In a word, we ask for any light, however small, that may assist in
illuminating an important subject.</p>

<p class='c006'>Above all, we ask you not to carelessly cast aside these words. It
is the earnest request of earnest men, seeking truth for its own sake
and wisely providing for the historic vindication of their race and
name from the possible aspersions of future ignorance and prejudice.</p>

Society:</p>

<p class='c008'>(1.) <span class='sc'>The American-Irish Historical Society: What It Is and
What Its Purposes Are.</span> Boston, Mass., 1897.</p>

<p class='c006'>This was issued at Boston, some time after the founding of the
Society. It was a small booklet of twelve pages containing a statement
of the Society’s objects, a list of the officers, and other matter
bearing upon the work of the organization. So much interest
was displayed, that the edition was soon exhausted.</p>

<hr class='c023' />

<p class='c008'>(2.) <span class='sc'>The American-Irish Historical Society: What It Is And
What Its Purposes Are, Together With the Names of the
Officers and a List of the Members.</span> Boston, Mass., 1898.</p>

<p class='c006'>To a certain extent, this was a second edition of the previous
publication, but larger and more comprehensive. It comprised 32
pages, and had a portrait of President-General Meade as a frontispiece.
The work is now out of print.</p>

<hr class='c023' />

With Some Reference to the Present “Anglo-Saxon” Comedy.</span>
Washington, D. C., 1898.</p>

<p class='c006'>This was a handsomely gotten up pamphlet of 29 pages, the
author being a member of the Society, Joseph Smith, of Lowell,
Mass. It was issued in September, 1898. An edition of 1,500
copies was brought out. A few copies remain on hand.</p>

<hr class='c023' />

<p class='c008'>(4.) <span class='sc'>Irish Schoolmasters in the American Colonies, 1640‒1775,
With a Continuation of the Subject During and After
the War of the Revolution.</span> Washington, D. C., 1898.</p>

<p class='c006'>This work was issued in August of the year mentioned, the authors
being two members of the Society, Thomas Hamilton Murray,
secretary-general, and Hon. John C. Linehan, treasurer-general.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>It was a very attractive pamphlet of 31 pages and contained mention
of over forty Irish teachers. The Society issued an edition of
2,000 copies of the work. Some fifty are still on hand.</p>

<hr class='c023' />

<p class='c008'>(5.) <span class='sc'>The Journal of The American-Irish Historical Society.
Vol. I.</span> Boston, Mass., 1898.</p>

<p class='c006'>A volume comprising 136 pages, substantially bound in cloth,
and having 28 illustrations. It contained the call for the meeting to
organize the Society, the names of the signers, the agreement of association,
the preamble and constitution and much other matter relating
to the founding of the organization. An edition of about
1,000 copies was issued. All have been distributed. The work was
electrotyped by Ginn &amp; Company, the Boston publishers, so that a
second edition can be brought out later at comparatively small
expense.</p>

<hr class='c023' />

<p class='c008'>(6.) <span class='sc'>The Journal of The American-Irish Historical Society.
Vol. II.</span> Boston, Mass., 1899.</p>

<p class='c006'>A handsome volume of 258 pages, having 41 illustrations. It is
finely bound in cloth, and contains a mass of interesting facts relating
to the history of the Irish element in the United States. A
leading feature in the work is the Chronology of the Society, giving in
regular order the leading events thus far in the career of the organization.
An edition of 1,000 bound, and 100 unbound, copies was issued.
The bound copies have been distributed, with the exception of 25
still left over. The unbound copies are held, subject to the direction
of the Society.</p>

<hr class='c023' />

Bearing Irish Names Who Fought Against the British in
the Action of the Seventeenth of June, 1775.</span> Boston,
Mass., 1900.</p>

list comprised 189 names, including such as Burke, Callahan, Carroll,
Cavenaugh, Connelly, Connor, Kelley, Leary, Lynch, Maguire,

<p class='c006'>The present work, of which 1,000 bound, and 100 unbound,
copies are issued. Like Vols. I and II, a copy of this is sent to
every member of the Society in good standing. Copies are also to
be presented to public libraries, historical societies, college libraries
and other educational institutions. The 100 unbound copies await
the pleasure of the Society.</p>

    <dd><cite>The Boston Globe</cite>, <cite>Herald</cite>, and other papers contained reports
    concerning the formation of the Society. <cite>The Springfield</cite> (Mass.)
    <cite>Republican</cite> said: “The American-Irish Historical society, organized at Boston
    yesterday with a remarkable list of officers and the assurance of a charter membership as
    noteworthy, will prove without question a body of real public importance.... Among those
    present at the meeting mostly from Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Rhode
    <span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>Island, was Edward A. Hall, of this city, whose history of the Irish in Hampden
    county has grown into a history of the Irish in western Massachusetts, where, in fact,
    they settled a great number of the hill towns, and their descendants live to this day....
    It will be the work of the Society to show what a vast influence the Irish element had in
    building our free commonwealths whose alliance made the first great country of the
    people, in which with all its faults reposes the hope of the progress of the world into a
    world of the people instead of one of warring dynasties and vicious religious hatreds,
    setting nation against nation. We look to this Society for active, earnest, ardent work
    for the enlightenment, brotherhood and unity of this people first, and of all other
    peoples in the long event. God hath made of one blood all the nations of the earth.”

    from there with two brothers, and enlisted under Sir William Pepperill. Barnabas sailed
    from Portsmouth, N. H.,—one of the force of 3,000 men, 1745, and on the Isle of Cape
    Breton, under Fort Louisburg, left his right arm. Subsequently, he settled in Rochester,

transmitting her valuable paper on “The Irish Settlers of Pelham, Mass.,” Miss Linehan of
Hartford, Conn., writes relative to Shays’ Rebellion:  “Daniel Shea,” the acknowledged
leader, had his name spelled in various ways. In American histories it is spelled “Shays.”
The writers of these histories have evidently never taken very great pains to look up this
Irishman. I find that the name is spelled Shea, Sheas, Sha, Shays, Shay, also Shess and
Shass. Spelling in his day was, very evidently, phonetic. As he is said to have come from
Cork, Ireland, I have no doubt whatever but that he originally spelled his name as they do in
that country to-day,—Shea. In a receipt given before the war he spells the name “Shea.” In
a note given after the war he spells his name “Shays.” My authority, outside of the receipt
and note are the town records of Pelham, Mass., where the various spelling of the name is
given. The correspondence between him and Gen. Lincoln, 1787, may be found in the
Massachusetts Archives, State House, Boston, Mass.</p>

<p class='c012'>From Rev. George F. Marshall, Milford, N. H.: “The second volume
of the American-Irish Historical Journal to hand. It is a wonder, considering
the age of the Society and its resources. A few more years’ work of the
Society, and the mythical Anglo-Saxon and threadbare Scotch-Irish will
have only a small place in the upbuilding of Yankeedom.”</p>

<p class='c012'>From Mr. William F. Clare, New York City: “I beg to acknowledge
receipt of the Journal of the American-Irish Historical Society for 1899.
Thanking you for the same, and complimenting you upon its tasty appearance

personnel of the Society.”</p>

<p class='c012'>From Mr. John J. Davis, Greenville, Penn.: “I am very grateful for the
copy of Volume II of the Journal of the Society, which you sent me. I

<p class='c012'>From Mr. Edward Fitzpatrick, Louisville (Ky.) <cite>Daily Times</cite>: “I thought
I would take occasion to write to acknowledge the receipt of your recent
annual publication. It is very fine, indeed, and I want to compliment you on
its splendid typographical appearance. It is carefully edited, and I think
reflects great credit upon you and the Society. The indexing is perfect,
and the chronology detailing the work heretofore done could not, in my opinion,
be improved upon.”</p>

<p class='c012'>From Hon. P. T. Barry, Chicago, Ill.: “Accept my apology for not
acknowledging receipt of the second volume of the American-Irish Historical
Society work before now. The fact is, I have been East, and only came

you upon its appearance and completeness.”</p>

peaceful Sunday afternoon. I am sure that my interest in the Society and in
its grand work has been immensely quickened and that, in the future, I shall

the past.”</p>

<p class='c012'>From the Public Library, Sacramento, Cal.: “The board of trustees of
Sacramento Free Public Library desire to return their thanks for your generous
donation of Volume II of the Journal of the American-Irish Historical

free to the reading public. By order of the board. Samuel H. Gerrish,

acknowledge that I have received the above named book. Caroline G.
Hancock, Librarian.”</p>

<p class='c012'>From Mr. Charles McCarthy, Jr., Portland, Me.: “I thank you very
much for the second volume of the Journal of the American-Irish Historical
Society which I received a few days ago, but have not yet had time to read
much of. I did, however, read Dr. Emmet’s paper on ‘Irish Emigration
During the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries,’ and your ‘Irish Chapter
in the History of Brown University,’ both of which place not only the
members of the Society under obligation to you, but the Irish race as well.
Such papers cannot but be of service in wearing away the prejudice of many
of our American fellow-citizens.”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>From Mr. Joseph Geoghegan, Salt Lake City, Utah: “Dear Mr. Murray:—You
must excuse my delay in acknowledging the receipt of the second
volume of the American-Irish Historical Society. I received it and was
very much pleased, indeed, at its completeness and feel that you are to be
very highly complimented on your work. It is a credit to a society that
might have been in existence for a hundred years. If at any time the funds
of the Society should get into such a shape that a call would be necessary, I
will be only too pleased to respond for any amount that you might suggest.”</p>

<p class='c012'>From the librarian of the Long Island Historical Society, Brooklyn, N.
Y.: “It is with pleasure that I acknowledge your Journal of the American-Irish
Historical Society, Volume II. From the note at the end of the volume,
I presume that it will be impossible for us to secure your first volume,
which we much regret, as it is the kind of work that should find a permanent
home in a library such as ours, which is for reference only. Would it
be possible for us to obtain any other of your writings, such as the Irish
Schoolmasters in the Colonies and the Irish Washingtons at Home and
Abroad? We would appreciate any publication of this kind. We have a
library of over 64,000 volumes.”</p>

<p class='c012'>From Hon. James F. Brennan, Peterborough, N. H., state library commissioner:
“<span class='sc'>Bro. Murray</span>:—I am in receipt of the second volume of
the Journal of the American-Irish Historical Society, and I wish to congratulate
you upon its excellent appearance. It shows conscientious work
on your part. The Chronological Record of the Society is a most excellent
thing, and the index that you give is certainly matchless. I think an index
is the most important thing about a book of this character, and your work
in that regard has fulfilled every desire. There is no danger of having an
index contain too much, but there is great danger of having it contain too
little. Your earnest work is visible on every page of this volume, and I
wish to thank you, as a member of the Society, for your conscientious
labors.”</p>

    <div><span class='sc'>40 East 68th Street, New York,</span></div>
    <div><span class='sc'>April 15, <a href='#Page_190'>190</a>1.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>My Dear Mr. Murray</span>:—It is with pleasure I
acknowledge the receipt of your advice that the Annual
Volume of our Historical Society is about
ready for distribution to our members.</p>

<p class='c006'>This will be the third volume so distributed,
the series showing a constant increase in historical
value and interest. We have undertaken a task
and set a high standard, to which are attached great
responsibilities, which must be maintained and
continued. I trust the end of the twentieth century
will find our society still vigorous.</p>

<p class='c006'>During the last century many pretentious efforts
were made to collect and publish matters of general
interest in regard to the Irish and their descendants
in America. They failed primarily for want
of an organization to support their efforts. The
organization we have; the means we require. Work
of this character costs much, and cannot be continued
on a scale to do it justice, without a substantial
treasury.</p>

<p class='c006'>We would have ample means modestly to continue
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>our work without extending it beyond prudent
requirements, if each member of the Society
would pay his annual dues.</p>

<p class='c006'>The honor of belonging to such a Society as ours
should be a matter of pride with our members and
everyone should keep in good standing. It is a requirement
that dues should be paid. It would certainly
be a reflection on a member to be dropped,
and still there is no alternative.</p>

<p class='c006'>Any of our annual members may become life
members by the payment of $50. A number of
gentlemen have already taken this step, and their
generosity is to be commended as having been
specially helpful to the Society. If this letter be
circulated among our members, I would urge as
many as possible to present their names for life membership.
From the dues thus derived, I hope
to see established a permanent fund, which when
wisely and safely invested, will assure the Society
an income with which to go forward and enlarge
its work.</p>

<p class='c006'>It should be borne in mind that the American-Irish
Historical Society is not a political organization.
Its object is the study and handing down of
Irish and Irish-American history, and it should be
brought to the highest possible standard.</p>

<p class='c006'>Thus far, our career as an historical organization
has been replete with earnest and successful work.
The future is bright for a continuance of our great
mission; the field is large, the cause noble, the end
patriotic, far-reaching, magnificent.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>In conclusion let me again urge our members to
come forward in answer to this appeal, with their
contributions, large and small. There are but a
few hundred dollars in our treasury, when there
should be thousands.</p>

<p class='c006'>It will be highly encouraging to the officers of
the Society to see that this appeal is met with a
prompt and generous response.</p>

<p class='c006'>With my heartiest and kindest greetings to all
our members, believe me</p>

and “McSparran.” In his work “America Dissected,” he repeatedly spells it “MacSparran,”
while on other occasions he frequently uses the abbreviated form “McSparran.”</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f8'>
<p class='c006'><a href='#r8'>8</a>. In Mac Sparran’s time great latitude was exercised, even by educated people, in the matter
of orthography, including proper names.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f9'>
<p class='c006'><a href='#r9'>9</a>. It will be noticed that Dr. Mac Sparran never uses the cant term “Scotch-Irish.” His
education, good sense and patriotic spirit raised him above such a subterfuge.</p>

<p class='c006'><a href='#r13'>13</a>. The claim has been made that the slaves were kindly treated in Rhode Island. No doubt
they were in many cases, but so, in some instances, were those in the South. Still, at the
best it was slavery, and the very nature of this traffic in human beings must have been equivalent
to injustice, oppression and cruelty.</p>

agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
